;;; Description : A module which uses all the options that were available in '08,
;;;               but there are more now which should be added to this at some
;;;               point like multi-buffers and the run-start/run-stop options.
;;; 
;;; Bugs        : 
;;;
;;; To do       : [] Add the rest of the module options which are available now.

;;; ----- History -----
;;; 2008.09.26 Dan
;;;             : * Initial creation.
;;; 2012.03.23 Dan [1.0b2]
;;;             : * Fixed bugs that someone just pointed out...
;;; 2014.03.17 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Changed the query-buffer call to be consistent with the new
;;;             :   internal code.
;;; 2014.08.13 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Changed the request function since chunks and chunk-specs
;;;             :   no longer have a type, but still haven't added all the other
;;;             :   module components.
;;; 2018.05.08 Dan [4.0b1]
;;;             : * Reworked for the new ACT-R 7.6+ software because model-output
;;;             :   can't be used during reset, and the query status function 
;;;             :   now should return the string not actually output it.
;;; 2020.01.10 Dan [4.0b2]
;;;             : * Removed the #' from the parameter valid function since 
;;;             :   that's not allowed in the general system now.
;;; 2020.06.01 Dan [5.0]
;;;             : * Define the chunk-types in the creation function instead of
;;;             :   the reset function now.
;;; 2021.06.14 Dan
;;;             : * Check the storability of the chunk in the clear buffer fn.

;;; General Docs:
;;; 
;;; This example module will use many of the possible components
;;; for a module.  It will perform actions that are similar to
;;; the goal buffer but will also print out a trace of when the 
;;; particular functions are called and what the parameters to
;;; those functions are as the corresponding model is run.
;;;
;;; The module will be called demo.  It will have two buffers 
;;; called demo1 and demo2.  It will add a parameter called
;;; :demo-param and will also monitor the :esc parameter.
;;; It will adjust the do-not-harvest parameter so that
;;; the demo1 buffer does not get strict harvested.
;;; 
;;; The demo1 buffer will have the default spreading activation
;;; parameter and value.  It will have no specific request 
;;; parameters or additional queries.
;;;
;;; The demo2 buffer will have a spreading activation parameter
;;; called demo2-spread with a default value of 3.  It will
;;; accept a request parameter called :value.  It will respond
;;; to an additional query called detect-jam with values of t
;;; or nil, and it will print out that query's status with the 
;;; buffer-status info.
;;;
;;; Requests to the demo1 buffer will act like goal buffer
;;; requests and a new chunk will be created immediately for
;;; that buffer.
;;;
;;; Modification requests to the demo1 buffer will also act like
;;; goal buffer modification requests and immediately make the
;;; requested changes.
;;;
;;; Requests to the demo2 buffer must be of the type create-chunk.
;;; They will create a chunk of type result in the demo2 buffer
;;; after 100 ms pass.  If the value request parameter is specified
;;; with the = modifier (the default if no other modifier provided) 
;;; in the request then the chunk created will have that value in
;;; the answer slot of the chunk created. 
;;;
;;; Modification requests to the demo2 buffer are only accepted
;;; if the chunk in the demo2 buffer is of type result.  If it
;;; is, then the answer slot of that chunk will be changed to the one 
;;; provided in the modification request after the amount of time 
;;; specified by the :demo-param parameter passes.
;;; 
;;; The demo2 buffer can only process one request or modification 
;;; request at a time.  If a second request is received while
;;; it is handling one a warning will be output, the second request
;;; will be ignored and it will signal its detect-jam query.
;;;
;;; Queries to the demo1 buffer will always respond as busy nil,
;;; free t, and error nil. 
;;;
;;; Queries to the demo2 buffer will report as busy during a
;;; request or a modification request and free otherwise.  It
;;; will report an error if it receives an invalid request or modification
;;; request and that error will remain true until a valid request or 
;;; modification request is made.  It will report detect-jam as t if it
;;; receives overlapping reqests.  The detect-jam will remain 
;;; true until the current request completes.
;;;
;;; One thing to note is that this module is not thread safe since it is already
;;; complicated enough as an example.  Thread safety is important because it is
;;; possible for there to be concurrent access to the internals of the module.
;;; To protect it one should lock all access to anything that uses the slots of
;;; the module's structure, and the second-retrieval-buffer example module
;;; shows that being done if you would like to see an example.
