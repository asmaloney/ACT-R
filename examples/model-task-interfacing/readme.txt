This directory contains several different implementations of a very simple
two player game along with models that are capable of playing against each
other in that game (they only make random moves for demonstration purposes).
Those different implementations provide examples of different interfacing
mechanisms which are available for any task interface construction - not 
just multiple model games.

Details on the game and the different interface approachs used can be found
in the slides in the multiple-models-and-task-interactions.pdf file which 
is also located in this directory.
