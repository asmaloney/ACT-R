;;; Description : Source for RPM's Audition Module
;;; 
;;; Bugs        : * 
;;; 
;;; Todo        : * [x] Should there be audio buffer stuffing as well?
;;;             : * [X] Add a set-audioloc-defaults command like the set-visloc-
;;;             :       default to give more control over stuffing so that
;;;             :       the :hear-newest-only parameter can go away.
;;;             : * [X] Change the request function so that modifiers and ranges
;;;             :       are accepted and add pitch as an option (alternatively
;;;             :       convert the audicon over to holding chunks and use the
;;;             :       more general chunk matching tools...)
;;;             : * [ ] Should it automatically stuff aural-location when there
;;;             :       are events in the audicon and the buffer is cleared 
;;;             :       instead of waiting for a change before doing so?
;;;             : * [X] Deal with possible long run timing issues due to 
;;;             :       floating point imprecision since detection time involves 
;;;             :       an addition of a "current" time which could be too big
;;;             :       to represent milliseconds with a delay that's likely to be
;;;             :       in the 50-200ms range.
;;;             : * [ ] There's a problem with using the ID and EVENT slots to
;;;             :       point to the original chunk since that means it has to
;;;             :       stay around (can't just delete it when done).  The right
;;;             :       solution is to work like vision where the object chunk
;;;             :       refers to the actual location chunk in the buffer and the
;;;             :       location chunk doesn't have a "self link" which will 
;;;             :       require changing how things map back to the module chunks.
;;; ----- History -----
;;; 
;;; 2005.01.07 mdb [act6a1]
;;;             : Transition to ACT6 stuff.
;;; 2005.01.08 Dan
;;;             : More updates to move to 6
;;;             :
;;;             : Changed aural-location to audio-event in request-audio-module
;;;             : (alternatively audio-event could be changed to aural-location
;;;             : in reset-audio-module but this way is backward compatible 
;;;             : to ACT-R 5)
;;;             :
;;;             : Removed the :offset parameter in the scheduling of find-sound
;;;             : in request-audio-module because it isn't defined in find-sound
;;;             :
;;;             : Changed find-sound to put the chunk into the buffer
;;;             :
;;;             : Changed find-sound because the chunk that comes in doesn't
;;;             : have the same name as the one in the audicon because it will
;;;             : be a copy from the buffer.  
;;;             :
;;;             : To get around that (for now at least) I've added an id slot
;;;             : to the audio-event chunk-type which will always have the
;;;             : original value.
;;;             :
;;;             : The event->dmo method was modified to set that value.
;;;             : 
;;;             : Changed audio-encoding-complete so that it sets the chunk
;;;             : in the aural buffer.  
;;;             :
;;;             : Related to the issue above with sound event names - the 
;;;             : sound put into the buffer has its event set to the "original" 
;;;             : event name (the id slot of the audio-event) which doesn't 
;;;             : correspond to the name of a chunk in DM, but it will match
;;;             : an audio-event with that value in its id slot (assuming the
;;;             : aural-location buffer has cleared so that the chunk goes to
;;;             : DM).
;;;             : 
;;;             : That seems reasonable for now at least.  
;;;             :
;;;             : Put the aural-location stuffing in:
;;;             ; Added the :around method for new-sound-event
;;;             : Added the stuff-sound-buffer function.
;;;             :
;;; 2005.01.09 Dan
;;;             : Added the clearing of the audicon to the reset-audio-module
;;;             : function.
;;;             : Added the word chunk to the audicon.
;;; 2005.01.10 Dan
;;;             : Maintain the stuffed slot of the audio module now since
;;;             : I added the buffer stuffing back in.
;;; 2005.01.11 mdb
;;;             : Put in parameter doc strings.
;;; 2005.01.21 Dan
;;;             : * Removed use of buffer-chunk and replaced with buffer-read.
;;; 2005.01.21 Dan
;;;             : * Wrapped the proclaim in an eval-when because otherwise
;;;             :   it may not actually affect the compilation.
;;; 2005.02.03 Dan
;;;             : * Added ":output 'medium" to some of the events that are
;;;             :   scheduled to play friendly with the new detail level.
;;; 2005.04.23 Dan
;;;             : * Updated find-sound so that it indicates whether the chunk
;;;             :   being put into the buffer was stuffed or not.
;;;             : * Changed stuff-sound-buffer to indicate that.
;;;             : * Removed the check of stuffed from query-audio-module.
;;;             : * Added attended as a possible query but I'm unsure if I've
;;;             :   got the testing quite right...
;;; 2005.04.29 Dan
;;;             : * Added a print-audicon command that works basically like
;;;             :   print-visicon for visual - it prints a table of info for
;;;             :   the sound-events currently in the audicon.
;;; 2005.07.22 Dan
;;;             : * Updated the module definition to use the pm-module-request
;;;             :   method and renamed the audio-module-request function 
;;;             :   accordingly.
;;; 2005.08.03 Dan
;;;             : * Added a find-sound-failure event to the trace when find-
;;;             :   sound fails.  Also adjusted the find-sound event scheduling
;;;             :   so that it gets output in the medium level trace detail.
;;; 2005.08.10 Dan
;;;             : * Commented out the offset value in the audio-event request
;;;             :   because it wasn't used.
;;; 2005.12.14 Dan
;;;             : * Added :sound-decay-time parameter which seems to have been
;;;             :   lost in the move to 6.
;;; 2006.01.04 Dan
;;;             : * Removed a duplicate instance of :tone-recode-delay in the
;;;             :   case of the parameter handling in params-audio-module and 
;;;             :   replaced it with :tone-detect-delay (which is what it 
;;;             :   should have been). 
;;; 2006.03.24 Dan
;;;             : * Added a new parameter called :hear-newest-only and changed 
;;;             :   stuff-sound-buffer to include :onset :highest when that's
;;;             :   set because it seems like often one might want the newest 
;;;             :   sound to be the one that gets stuffed into the buffer. 
;;;             :   The default is nil to keep it compatible with the old
;;;             :   version for now, but should it default to t?
;;; 2006.05.03 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in pm-module-request for aural-location requests
;;;             :   in specifying the location (it was testing the onset slot.)
;;; 2006.05.03 Dan
;;;             : * Turns out that loc-failure and attend-failure weren't
;;;             :   really being set/cleared so add that in now.
;;; 2006.05.03 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed attend-sound so that it checks the current-audicon
;;;             :   so that old sounds get purged as needed.
;;; 2006.09.08 Dan
;;;             : * Changed several parameter tests from posnum to nonneg.
;;; 2006.11.20 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the bug in stuff-sound-buffer because it should be
;;;             :   :onset 'highest not :highest...
;;;             : * Changed the version to 2.2 (dropped the a1) and updated the
;;;             :   doc string so that it doesn't say "first pass".
;;; 2006.12.20 Dan 
;;;             : * Changed the version in the class definition too...
;;; 2007.01.03 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the scheduling of the stuff-sound-buffer event
;;;             :   to :output nil and :maintenance t because the set-buffer-chunk 
;;;             :   ... requested nil shows that the stuffing occurs already - 
;;;             :   no point in two events showing for the same thing.
;;;             : * Also changed the test for the empty buffer slightly because
;;;             :   buffer-read is a bit of a hack for that purpose.
;;;             : * Took attended out of the audio-event chunk-type and made it
;;;             :   a request parameter instead (actually just started using the 
;;;             :   request parameter that was already there).
;;; 2007.01.04 Dan
;;;             : * Took the string column out of the audicon printing because
;;;             :   its going to be the same as content when it's provided.
;;;             : * Similarly, changed the content column to be printed with
;;;             :   ~s instead of ~a so that strings are differentiated from
;;;             :   symbols for content.
;;;             : * Added a column for detectable to the audicon printing.
;;;             : * Changed attend-sound to check exec-s instead of check-jam
;;;             :   because the attend-sound doesn't set the preparation state
;;;             :   to busy (which is what check-jam looks at).
;;;             : * Use randomize-time in scheduling the attend-sound-failure
;;;             :   event.
;;;             : * Removed the update function from the module definition
;;;             :   because it didn't do anything.
;;;             : * Fixed new-sound-event to better check for model/mp/module
;;;             :   and report a warning if not available - also switched the
;;;             :   return value to t/nil instead of returning the stuff-sound
;;;             :   scheduler event.
;;;             : * Converted the new-*-sound methods to functions so that
;;;             :   parameter validation is handled explicitly.  So that
;;;             :   ACT-R warnings can be printed instead of Lisp errors being
;;;             :   generated when invalid values are used (yes there are more
;;;             :   "CLOS-y" ways of doing it, but call me old fashioned...).
;;;             : * Took the optional instr parameter out of new-other-sound
;;;             :   because the string component of the sound-events doesn't
;;;             :   really have a purpose. [Or am I missing something?]
;;; 2007.01.10 Dan
;;;             : * Added location and kind optional parameters to new-other-sound.
;;;             : * Changed the call to get-articulation-time because the 
;;;             :   speech module is no longer needed as a parameter (though the
;;;             :   module itself still needs to exist).
;;; 2007.01.18 Dan
;;;             : * Turns out that stuff-sound-buffer can't be a maintenance
;;;             :   event because that event needs to be able to trigger
;;;             :   conflict-resolution because until the schedule-set-buffer-chunk
;;;             :   event gets scheduled other model events could have pushed
;;;             :   conflict-resolution into the future... (probably doesn't
;;;             :   make sense to anyone else, but I know what it means)
;;; 2007.03.29 Dan
;;;             : * Incremented version to 2.3.
;;;             : * Added the set-audloc-default command and depricated the
;;;             :   hear-newest-only parameter because of that.
;;; 2007.04.03 Dan
;;;             : * Some cleanup of the set-audloc-default command - better
;;;             :   testing of params and validity (allowing none for example).
;;; 2008.06.03 Dan
;;;             : * Added an after method for clear to clear the error states
;;;             :   as is done for vision, but maybe that needs to move up to
;;;             :   the attn-module class method.
;;; 2011.04.28 Dan
;;;             : * Added a declaim to avoid a compiler warning about an
;;;             :   undefined function.
;;; 2011.05.16 Dan
;;;             : * Replaced pm-warning calls with model-warning.
;;; 2011.05.17 Dan
;;;             : * Replaced queue-command calls with schedule-event-relative.
;;; 2011.05.18 Dan
;;;             : * Removed detectable-time since it was the same as detect-at-time
;;;             :   and there's no need for two methods that compute the same thing.
;;;             : * Starting to convert over to using ms internally for the sound-
;;;             :   event components to avoid issues with math on seconds.
;;; 2011.11.09 Dan
;;;             : * Commented out the *enable-package-locked-errors* line for ACL 
;;;             :   because it no longer seems to be necessary and it sets up a 
;;;             :   dangerous situation for users since that setting enables the
;;;             :   redefinition of CL functions without warning.
;;; 2012.05.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with the offset time of the audio-event chunks
;;;             :   being in ms while the onset was in seconds.
;;; 2012.05.14 Dan [2.4]
;;;             : * Added another request parameter to the aural-location buffer:
;;;             :   :finished.  It can be requested as t or nil to determine if 
;;;             :   a sound is already completed or not.
;;;             : * A corresponding finished query is also available which works
;;;             :   like the attended query -- if there is a chunk in the buffer
;;;             :   then finished tests whether the property of that chunk matches
;;;             :   the queried value.
;;;             : * Changed the finished-p method so it always returns t or nil
;;;             :   since >= only returns a generalized boolean and that matters
;;;             :   for testing in the query.
;;;             : * Updated set-audloc-default so that it also accepts finished.
;;;             : * Added a duration slot to the audio-event type so that one
;;;             :   doesn't have to do the math with offset and onset values.
;;;             : * Added the audio-event-ended function which gets scheduled 
;;;             :   by attend-sound to set the offset and duration of the chunk
;;;             :   in the aural-location buffer if it's still there when the 
;;;             :   attended sound stops.
;;; 2013.10.02 Dan
;;;             : * Commented out the optimize proclaim since that persists and
;;;             :   may or may not be useful anyway.
;;; 2014.03.17 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Changed the query-buffer call to be consistent with the new
;;;             :   internal code.
;;; 2014.05.16 Dan
;;;             : * Continue the conversion to type-less chunks.
;;;             : * First step is to switch over to testing the chunks in the audicon!
;;;             : * Print-audicon sorts the events by onset time (lowest first).
;;; 2014.05.19 Dan
;;;             : * New-other-sound now allows for specifying additional slots and
;;;             :   values for the event and/or the sound chunks.  They are provided
;;;             :   as 3 element lists after all the optional parameters.  The first
;;;             :   item in the list is either :evt, :sound, or :both to indicate
;;;             :   which chunk gets the slot and value specified with the second 
;;;             :   and third items respectively.
;;;             : * Testing the chunks in the audicon instead of the sound-event
;;;             :   object allows for +aural-location to specify things more freely:
;;;             :   slots can be specified more than once, any operator is allowed,
;;;             :   user specified slots for an event can be provided, and higest and
;;;             :   lowest can be used for any slot.
;;; 2014.05.30 Dan
;;;             : * Use the test-for-clear-request function in pm-module-request.
;;;             : * Use an isa sound/audio-event when creating the chunks so that
;;;             :   the "backward" slots exist when needed.
;;; 2014.08.13 Dan
;;;             : * Either I can't use the name of the audicon chunk in the ID
;;;             :   and EVENT slots or I can't delete that chunk when it leaves
;;;             :   the audicon!  I think the right solution is to get rid of 
;;;             :   the ID slot and have the EVENT refer to the actual audio-event
;;;             :   chunk that's in the buffer, but that requires a lot of reworking
;;;             :   things (like the internals of vision so that things can refer
;;;             :   to the original internal module chunk).  So, for now
;;; 2014.10.30 Dan [3.1]
;;;             : * I guess that should have said "for now leave it alone and
;;;             :   don't delete the chunks".
;;;             : * Eliminating the previously depricated :hear-newest-only
;;;             :   parameter.
;;;             : * Changed the last-command value for an aural-location request
;;;             :   from audio-event to find-sound.
;;;             : * Added an event to the queue when a set-audloc-default request
;;;             :   is processed.
;;;             : * Added some more chunks to those defined by the module.
;;; 2015.03.20 Dan
;;;             : * Failures now set the buffer failure flags using set-buffer-failure.
;;; 2015.03.23 Dan
;;;             : * Specify whether a find-sound-failure is requested or not i.e.
;;;             :   if it's stuffed then that's not requested.
;;; 2015.04.22 Dan [3.2]
;;;             : * Add the unstuff-aural-location parameter which will cause

;;;             : * Report onset and offset times in milliseconds now to avoid

;;;             : * Fixed a bug in one of the calls to schedule-event-now that
;;;             :   was replacing a relative 0.
;;; 2015.07.28 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the logical to ACT-R-support in the require-compiled.
;;;             : * Changed default value of unstuff-aural-location to t.
;;; 2015.07.29 Dan [3.4]
;;;             : * Changed the way the check-unstuff-buffer action is scheduled
;;;             :   because that's now the precondition and unstuff-buffer is the
;;;             :   actual action.
;;;             : * Splitting the unstuff- parameter into two parameters:
;;;             :   :unstuff-aural-location can be nil, t, or # and indicates
;;;             :     whether to take a stuffed chunk out of the buffer and
;;;             :     defaults to t.
;;;             :   :overstuff-aural-location determines whether or not to 
;;;             :     stuff a new chunk overtop of a previously stuffed chunk
;;;             :     and defaults to nil.
;;;             : * When an unstuff is scheduled save it so that it can be
;;;             :   deleted if another gets scheduled.
;;; 2015.07.30 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with the unstuffing time because it was computed
;;;             :   as an absolute time but scheduled as relative when set to t.
;;; 2015.07.31 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the default values for unstuff and overstuff.  They
;;;             :   are now nil and t respectively because that seems to work
;;;             :   better for the way audio gets used which is not as frequent
;;;             :   as speech output which triggers audio percepts so don't want
;;;             :   a potentially unused system affecting performance.
;;; 2015.08.17 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the randomize-time calls which were used with times
;;;             :   in ms to randomize-time-ms.
;;; 2015.09.17 Dan [4.0]
;;;             : * Making the aural buffer trackable and having it complete
;;;             :   requests.
;;;             : * Adding the last-aural-request slot to audio-module to hold
;;;             :   the request for completion.
;;; 2015.09.22 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed some syntax issues with the previous changes.
;;; 2016.01.11 Dan
;;;             : * Changed how print-audicon displays the location, it uses
;;;             :   a ~s instead of ~a in the format string, so that a string
;;;             :   value for locations shows up correctly.
;;; 2016.06.29 Dan [4.1]
;;;             : * Changing the default value for :overstuff-aural-location back
;;;             :   to nil for performance reasons.  If a model is speaking or
;;;             :   subvocalizing and not using the aural information that constant
;;;             :   re-stuffing of the buffer is costly, and if a model is using the
;;;             :   aural info, then it probably doesn't need to be overstuffed
;;;             :   anyway.
;;; 2016.07.15 Dan
;;;             : * The unstuff-buffer events didn't specify the module as audio
;;;             :   but do now.
;;; 2017.01.26 Dan [5.0]
;;;             : * Added remote versions of the new-{word|digit|tone}-sound 
;;;             :   commands.  New-other-sound hasn't been added yet because I'm
;;;             :   not sure what the right way to provide that should be since
;;;             :   the values for content and other features are arbitrary.
;;; 2017.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Add-act-r-command call parameters reordered.
;;; 2017.02.08 Dan
;;;             : * Reworked the local versions of the remote commands to not
;;;             :   go out through the dispatcher.
;;; 2017.05.23 Dan [5.1]
;;;             : * Instead of setting the offset and duration for the chunk in
;;;             :   the aural-location buffer if it's still there when a sound is
;;;             :   attended to (would require the model keep it around explicitly)
;;;             :   schedule that event when the chunk enters the aural-location
;;;             :   buffer because it's possible for the attention shift to occur
;;;             :   after the sound goes off which results in a warning that the
;;;             :   time has already passed.  Alternatively, it could check for the
;;;             :   current time to avoid the warning and continue to only update
;;;             :   the chunk when it's attended to, but I think it's better to
;;;             :   update it with the info when available.
;;;             : * The previous change breaks the current code for "overstuffing"
;;;             :   since when the sound ends it modifies the chunk in the buffer
;;;             :   which then prevents it from being replaced by a new stuffed
;;;             :   chunk.  The fix is to not require that the chunk is unmodified,
;;;             :   but that it is still a match to the original event information.
;;;             : * Do that test with a precondition and change the unstuffing 
;;;             :   precondition to deal with the possibility of a modification.
;;;             : * Audio-event-ended is now a maintenance event and only if there's
;;;             :   a change is a model event created -- this eliminates some 
;;;             :   spurious conflict-resolution tests when there wasn't really
;;;             :   a update because of the sound ending.
;;;             : * Actually use the version-string from the class to set the 
;;;             :   version in the model.
;;; 2017.07.14 Dan
;;;             : * Adding locks to protect the audicon and the parameters to
;;;             :   make things thread safe.
;;; 2017.08.03 Dan
;;;             : * Have new-sound-event call the new-sound function through the 
;;;             :   dispatcher for monitoring purposes.
;;; 2017.08.04 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the poor cut-and-paste job with the last update.
;;; 2017.08.09 Dan
;;;             : * Update the buffer-status function to return the string.
;;;             : * Added printed-audicon to return the output string.
;;;             : * Update the reset and clear code to directly change slot values
;;;             :   instead of relying on the attn-module methods.
;;;             : * Also don't use set/clear-attended methods.
;;; 2017.08.11 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a cut-and-paste error with the clear method.
;;; 2017.09.06 Dan
;;;             : * Make print-audicon and printed-audicon available remotely.
;;; 2017.09.21 Dan
;;;             : * Make new-sound a signal and schedule it to happen at the
;;;             :   onset time of the sound instead of calling it immediately 
;;;             :   upon the sound's creation.
;;;             : * Added a missing newline to the end of items in printed-audicon.
;;; 2018.01.26 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the buffer-status function to omit the extra newline.
;;; 2018.05.24 Dan
;;;             : * Added a details value to the scheduling of audio-encoding-
;;;             :   complete so that the trace shows the event instead of the
;;;             :   internal audicon structure.
;;;             : * Cleaned up new-other-sound so that it converts strings to
;;;             :   symbols and added a remote version.
;;; 2018.05.25 Dan
;;;             : * Added a remote set-audloc-default.
;;; 2018.06.01 Dan
;;;             : * Param-lock was moved to the pm-module class.
;;; 2018.06.12 Dan
;;;             : * Only external commands do the string conversion now.
;;;             : * Removed some verify-current-mp calls while updating things.
;;; 2018.07.26 Dan [5.2]
;;;             : * Removing the code to support request tracking.
;;; 2018.11.16 Dan [5.3]
;;;             : * Start to Add new parameters :aural-encoding-hook :aural-loc-
;;;             :   encoding-hook which work like :visual-encoding-hook to allow
;;;             :   the user to override the default timing. 
;;; 2018.11.19 Dan
;;;             : * Changing the parameter to :aural-loc-hook because it's not
;;;             :   the encoding, and works more like :retrieval-set-hook than
;;;             :   :visual-encoding-hook.
;;;             : * Grab the audicon-lock when setting an item as attended.
;;;             : * Current-marker doesn't seem to do anything.  So going to
;;;             :   use it for implementing the :aural-encoding-hook.  
;;;             : * Similarly, currently-attended isn't really used, but going
;;;             :   to keep setting it anyway.
;;;             : * Adding a lock around those two things now (don't know why
;;;             :   they didn't but probably because they weren't used).  The
;;;             :   new lock is the aural-attn-lock.
;;;             : * Added the schedule-audio-encoding-complete function to go
;;;             :   along with the :aural-encoding-hook.
;;; 2018.11.20 Dan
;;;             : * Added the remote schedule-audio-encoding-complete.
;;; 2020.01.10 Dan [5.4]
;;;             : * Removed the #' and lambdas from the module interface 
;;;             :   functions since that's not allowed in the general system
;;;             :   now.
;;; 2020.06.01 Dan [6.0]
;;;             : * Moved the chunk-type and chunk definition to the creation 
;;;             :   function instead of the reset function.
;;; 2020.08.26 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the path for require-compiled since it's not needed
;;;             :   and results in warnings in SBCL.
