;;; Description : Implementation of the goal module.
;;; 
;;; Bugs        : 
;;;
;;; To do       : 
;;; 
;;; ----- History -----
;;;
;;; 2004.10.13 Dan
;;;             : Initial creation.
;;;
;;; 2005.01.19 Dan
;;;             : Updated goal-focus to better match what ACT-R 4/5 did.
;;; 2005.02.22 Dan
;;;             : * Added a reset function to the goal to clear the stuffed flag
;;;             : * Changed the stuffed flag to holding the chunk that is set
;;;             :   by the user so that goal-focus can print a "pending" message
;;;             :   when queried between the goal-focus and the model actually
;;;             :   running to set the buffer.
;;; 2005.02.25 Dan
;;;             : * Clean up the "pending" info a little more so that if there
;;;                 is a chunk in the buffer things still "look" right.
;;; 2005.03.18 Dan
;;;             : * The goal buffer will not be strict harvested by default,
;;;             :   so the reset function is going to set that parameter.
;;; 2005.03.21 Dan 
;;;             : * Changing the version to 1.0b1.
;;; 2005.03.23 Dan
;;;             : * In order to set the do-not-harvest parameter correctly it 
;;;             :   do so after the defaults are set so goal uses the second
;;;             :   reset parameter to do its reseting (doesn't need the first).
;;; 2005.03.24 Dan
;;;             : * Undoing the setting of goal on do-not-havrest list for now
;;;             :   under the idea that parsimony is better overall.
;;; 2005.03.27 Dan
;;;             : * Back it goes - goal is once again set to not be strict
;;;             :   harvested by default.
;;; 2005.04.23 Dan
;;;             : * Stuffed is no longer a query for the module, but the 
;;;             :   internal slot has other uses.
;;; 2005.05.20 Dan
;;;             : * Renamed the stuffed slot to delayed and cleaned up how
;;;             :   it gets used becasue there were some situations where 
;;;             :   calling goal-focus resulted in incorrect information.
;;; 2005.07.06 Dan
;;;             : * Updated the docs and changed the version to 1.0.
;;; 2005.07.21 Dan
;;;             : * Changed mod-focus so that it schedules a notice of the
;;;             :   modification.  May want to actually schedule the mod, but
;;;             :   that could break some older/existing stuff so I want to be
;;;             :   safe for now.
;;; 2005.08.10 Dan
;;;             : * Updated goal-query to specify that the instance is ignored.
;;; 2006.07.20 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the goal-focus command so that the clean-up event
;;;             :   is flagged as a maintenance event.
;;; 2007.06.05 Dan
;;;             : * Added buffer modification requests as an option in the goal 
;;;             :   buffer.  Acts just like a production's buffer modification
;;;             :   except that with the + it's attributed to the goal module
;;;             :   instead of procedural i.e. there is no difference in performance
;;;             :   between the RHS actions:
;;;             :   =goal> slot value  
;;;             :   and 
;;;             :   +goal> slot value 
;;;             :   
;;;             :   The only difference will be in the output of the trace and
;;;             :   the buffer summary records.
;;; 2008.09.19 Dan 
;;;             : * Moved the mod-request function to goal-style support
;;;             :   and changed the goal module's definition to use it.
;;; 2013.03.20 Dan
;;;             : * Minor edits while verifying that it'll work with the typeless
;;;             :   chunk mechanism.
;;; 2015.02.11 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Change the default value for :ga from 1 to 0.  The imaginal
;;;             :   buffer is now the only one which spreads activation by default.
;;;             :   Should have made this change with the first version of 6.1.
;;; 2015.06.04 Dan
;;;             : * Use :time-in-ms t for all the scheduled events.
;;; 2015.07.28 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the logical to ACT-R-support in the require-compiled.
;;; 2016.09.27 Dan [2.1]
;;;             : * Mod-focus now does the modification in the scheduled event
;;;             :   instead of directly which makes a goal-focus then mod-focus
;;;             :   work which seems more natural for some simple situations.
;;; 2016.11.23 Dan
;;;             : * Modified goal-focus to work through the central dispatcher.
;;; 2016.12.01 Dan
;;;             : * Modified goal-focus-internal so that it will handle a string
;;;             :   containing the name of a chunk as well as the symbol.
;;; 2017.01.18 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the echo-act-r-output from goal-focus.  The assumption
;;;             :   now is that echoing is handled by the user.
;;;             : * Use handle-evaluate-results.
;;; 2017.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Add-act-r-command call parameters reordered.
;;; 2017.02.08 Dan
;;;             : * Reworked the local versions of the remote commands to not
;;;             :   go out through the dispatcher.
;;;             : * Added an external mod-focus command.
;;; 2017.02.15 Dan
;;;             : * For mod-focus, assume if the first item is a string then it
;;;             :   needs to be decoded.
;;; 2017.06.13 Dan
;;;             : * Add a lock to protect goal-module-delayed.
;;; 2017.12.13 Dan
;;;             : * Why didn't goal-focus check whether there was a goal module?
;;; 2018.06.12 Dan
;;;             : * Only the external commands should convert strings to names.
;;; 2020.01.10 Dan [2.2]
;;;             : * Removed the #' from the module interface functions since 
;;;             :   that's not allowed in the general system now.
;;; 2020.08.26 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the path for require-compiled since it's not needed
;;;             :   and results in warnings in SBCL.

;;;
;;; General Docs:
;;; 
;;; The goal module has one buffer called goal.
;;; The source spread parameter of the goal is called :ga and defaults to 0.
;;;
;;; The goal module responds to requests by creating a new chunk and placing it
;;; into the buffer.  The requests must be a unique specification of a chunk.
;;; Thus, no variables are allowed and each slot may be specified at most once.
;;; The new chunk is placed into the buffer at the same time as the request.
;;;
;;; It only responds to the required queries - state {busy, free, error} and 
;;; buffer {empty, full, requested, unrequested}.
;;;
;;; State free will always return t.
;;; State busy will always return nil.
;;; State error will always return nil.
;;; Buffer requested will respond nil if the goal chunk is created with the
;;;   goal-focus command otherwise it will respond t.
;;;
;;; The goal module now DOES respond to buffer modification requests.
;;; A buffer modification request acts just like the corresponding modification
;;; action in the production.  The only difference is that it is now attributed
;;; to the goal module - it still takes 0 time.

;;;   (defmacro goal-focus (&optional (chunk-name nil)))
;;;   (defun goal-focus-fct (&optional (chunk-name nil)))
;;; 
;;;   If the chunk-name is passed in then an event is scheduled to place a copy 
;;;   of that chunk into the goal buffer at the current time and t is returned.
;;;
;;;   If no chunk-name is given then the chunk currently in the goal buffer is
;;;   printed and that chunk's name is returned.

;;;   Modifies the chunk currently in the goal buffer using mod-chunk and the
