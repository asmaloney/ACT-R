;;; Description : Implements the declarative memory module.
;;; 
;;; Bugs        : 
;;;
;;; To do       : [x] Better storage of activation quantities (computed act.,
;;;             :     base-level, and Sji's) for reference since right now
;;;             :     it's all "on the fly" and only available in the trace.
;;;             : [ ] Consider a hook before the module merges cleared buffer
;;;             :     chunks into DM so that someone could have a chance to
;;;             :     touch them first, or maybe prioritize the notify fn's
;;;             :     so that people could hook into things better there.
;;;             : [ ] Consider allowing :recently-retrieved to be partial
;;;             :     matched.  Possibly a separate parameter which specifies
;;;             :     the penalty value.

;;; ----- History -----

;;; 2004.10.15 Dan
;;;             : Creation.
;;; 2004.12.06 Dan
;;;             : Fixed some issues with the hook fns when reset.
;;;             : Brought the line length down to 80.
;;; 2004.12.18 Dan
;;;             : Added the tracing info.
;;; 2005.01.09 Dan
;;;             : Playing around with some optimization ideas for merging
;;;             : since that really kills models with lots of buffer action...
;;;             :
;;;             : The first thought is to hash the chunk contents - the down
;;;             : side is that any mod-chunk to a chunk already in DM is going
;;;             : to cause problems with that.
;;;             : 
;;;             : Add the chunk-hash-table to dm structure.
;;;             : Modify the add-chunk-into-dm and merge-chunk-into-dm
;;;             : to take advantage of that.
;;;             :
;;;             : Seems to work and cuts zbrodoff time almost in half.
;;;             :
;;;             : So, adding it as an option with a new parameter for those
;;;             : that still want to mod-chunk DM.
;;; 2005.01.12 Dan
;;;             : * Updated version to 1.0a2
;;;             : * Shifted the commands to a dm-commands file in tools leaving
;;;             :   this file as solely responsible for the module interface.
;;; 2005.01.17 Dan
;;;             : * Removed calls to format in the scheduling functions.
;;; 2005.01.18 Dan
;;;             : * Added the ability to reset the dm finsts by passing reset
;;;             :   as the value of the :recently-retrieved request parameter.
;;; 2005.01.21 Dan
;;;             : * Did some minor optimizing by having DM organize its chunks
;;;             :   by chunk-type.  That seemed to be the bottle neck in most
;;;             :   of the tutorial models, so trying to speed that up some. 
;;;             : * Don't worry about setting fan unless spreading activation
;;;             :   is enabled.
;;; 2005.01.26 Dan
;;;             : * Changed chunk-base-level usage so that it gets set every
;;;             :   time a base-level is computed regardless of circumstances.
;;;             : * Added the spource-spread parameter to chunks to hold the
;;;             :   activation spread component of the computation.
;;; 2005.02.03 Dan
;;;             : * Added ":output 'medium" and ":output 'low" to some of the 
;;;             :   events that are scheduled to play friendly with the 
;;;             :   new detail level.
;;; 2005.02.04 Dan
;;;             : * Taking advantage of the fast-* chunk accessors.
;;; 2005.02.10 Dan
;;;             : * Switched to the use of expt-coerced, exp-coerced, and 
;;;             :   log-coerced.
;;; 2005.04.01 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the fast-mergeing mechanism to work over chunks
;;;             :   that have merged (but unchanged) chunks in their slots
;;;             :   by using true-chunk-name hash-chunk-contents.
;;; 2005.04.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the parameter setting for the hook functions so that
;;;             :   a value of nil clears it completely.
;;; 2005.04.23 Dan
;;;             : * Added recently-retrieved as a possible query and added
;;;             :   a buffer-status function to show it.
;;;             : * However, the query may not be what people want - the
;;;             :   query returns whether the chunk in the buffer has a
;;;             :   declarative-finst on it at the time of the query which 
;;;             :   may not be the same as when the request was made, but
;;;             :   this seems like the "right" thing to return.
;;; 2005.06.10 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug - terminating an ongoing retrieval didn't
;;;             :   properly clear the events if they had already been 
;;;             :   scheduled to occur.
;;; 2005.06.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with start-retrieval related to :recently-
;;;             :   retrieved reset because what happened is that it cleared
;;;             :   the finsts, but then wanted to find one that had a finst
;;;             :   that matched "reset" which always resulted in failure.
;;; 2005.06.16 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the reference count to only store as many as
;;;             :   are needed...
;;; 2005.06.28 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the :sa parameter and instead changed :mas to
;;;             :   act as both the switch and the value.
;;; 2005.07.29 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed base-level-activation so that if it tries to compute
;;;             :   the activation for a chunk with no references (not yet in
;;;             :   DM) for some reason it prints a warning and returns a very
;;;             :   large negative value.
;;; 2005.08.01 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug that resulted in BLC being added repeatedly
;;;             :   to the activation value.
;;;             :   Side effect is that right now sdp doesn't show the base-
;;;             :   level value (other than the blc) when bll is on.
;;;             :   See the Todo above...
;;;             : * Updated the version to 1.0.
;;; 2005.08.02 Dan
;;;             : * Modified the priority of start-retrieval so that it doesn't
;;;             :   start until the goal buffer has been set.
;;; 2006.06.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added a note to the to do list as a reminder of some thoughts
;;;             :   on an issue that someone might want/need in the future 
;;;             :   (dealing with chunks before they merge into DM) based on 
;;;             :   Mike's intrest in it now.
;;; 2006.07.10 Dan
;;;             : * Changed a call to true-chunk-name to true-chunk-name-fct in
;;;             :   hash-chunk-contents because true-chunk-name is now the macro.
;;; 2006.07.12 Dan
;;;             : * Actually removed the :sa parameter to get rid of the warning.
;;; 2006.08.08 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed spreading-activation so that it doesn't print a warning
;;;             :   when a buffer that should spread activation is empty.
;;; 2006.08.30 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug when partial matching is on - it wasn't taking
;;;             :   the comparison tests (>, <, >=, and <=) into account for a
;;;             :   retrieval request!
;;;             : * Also removed some of the comments that were no longer valid
;;;             :   which were there from the "sample" module details in the
;;;             :   old framework spec.
;;;             : * Reordered how the activation trace prints for partial
;;;             :   matching so things are a bit cleaner when there's a hook.
;;; 2006.09.08 Dan
;;;             : * Changed some parameter checks from posnum to nonneg and
;;;             :   updated the warnings appropriately.
;;; 2006.11.28 Dan
;;;             : * Took an unnecessary get-module out of the query function.
;;; 2006.11.29 Dan
;;;             : * The :pm parameter is now depricated - use :mp as both the
;;;             :   flag and value like :bll and :mas.
;;; 2006.11.30 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the fan parameter from chunks since it wasn't used
;;;             :   for anything now (the fan-list is what's important).
;;;             : * Updated chunks-similarity to use chunk-slot-equal instead
;;;             :   of equal for comparing non-chunk values.
;;; 2006.12.01 Dan
;;;             : * Cleaned up some comments in/around the base-level calculation.
;;; 2006.12.04 Dan
;;;             : * Added the last-base-level chunk parameter and changed the default
;;;             :   for the base-level chunk parameter to nil.
;;;             : * Modified the base-level calculation to set last-base-level and
;;;             :   so that the user setting overrides the :blc when :bll is nil
;;;             :   instead of being addative (makes it like ACT-R 4/5 now).
;;; 2006.12.05 Dan
;;;             : * Minor formatting changes - no real change.
;;; 2006.12.06 Dan
;;;             : * Added the retrieval-activation and retrieval-time 
;;;             :   parameters to the chunk to record the activation value
;;;             :   that it had during a retrieval request and the time at which
;;;             :   that request occured.
;;;             : * Updated the version to 1.1.
;;; 2007.08.15 Dan
;;;             : * Changed start-retrieval so that the chunk which will be
;;;             :   retrieved is the first element in the list passed to the
;;;             :   retrieval-set-hook function.
;;; 2008.02.27 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the parameter check to only throw the warning
;;;             :   when the "critical" parameters are adjusted.
;;; 2008.07.12 Dan 
;;;             : * Changed the text printed for the activation trace during
;;;             :   similarity calculations to avoid the potential confusion
;;;             :   that the similarity values are actually changing.
;;; 2008.07.12 Dan
;;;             : * Added the :w-hook parameter to allow one to differentially
;;;             :   specify the Wkj values.
;;; 2008.07.23 Dan
;;;             : * Added call to the new register-subsymbolic-parameters to
;;;             :   note which declarative parameters should trigger the warning.
;;; 2008.08.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with the retrieval-set-hook - when there was a
;;;             :   retrieval failure it got called with (nil) instead of just
;;;             :   nil.
;;; 2008.11.13 Dan
;;;             : * Added a secondary reset function to set the :dcsc-hook
;;;             :   parameter so that fast-mergeing works right in the context
;;;             :   of chunk normalizing i.e. the module can rehash the chunks
;;;             :   that change.
;;; 2008.12.10 Dan
;;;             : * Changed how the fan values are recorded to improve both
;;;             :   space and time.  Instead of a list on the j's now it's 
;;;             :   split into a fan-out and a fan-in.  The fan-out is just a
;;;             :   count of the total fan 'out' of the chunk (the length of
;;;             :   the old fan list) and the fan-in is the list of the chunk's
;;;             :   slot contents at the time it entered DM with thier counts.
;;;             :   So, now it doesn't have to search or count item on the fan-list
;;;             :   to do the calculation.  It instead searchs the fan-in list
;;;             :   which presumably is shorter than the old fan-list for most
;;;             :   chunks in most models and even if its not it doesn't have
;;;             :   to do the counting every time since that was set initially.
;;;             : * It also now addresses the issue of chunks which merge into DM
;;;             :   after they have had references credited to them.  Previously,
;;;             :   those other references were lost if the chunk actually merged
;;;             :   with an existing chunk in DM, but now they get tracked 
;;;             :   appropriately.
;;; 2008.12.11 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with the last change - a chunk didn't get saved
;;;             :   on its own fan-in list.
;;;             : * There also isn't likely any space savings in general - only
;;;             :   when there's duplicate instances of a value in slots (a 
;;;             :   fan-in other than 1).
;;; 2009.08.05 Dan
;;;             : * Added a new hook for the activation calculations.  The
;;;             :   :activation-offsets hook holds a list of functions to call
;;;             :   during activation computation.  A function on the hook will 
;;;             :   be called with the chunk name during the activation calculation
;;;             :   and if the function returns a number that value will be
;;;             :   added to the activation value for the chunk.  
;;;             :   This hook will make it easier to extend the activation
;;;             :   calculation without having to completely redefine one of the
;;;             :   existing components via the other hooks.
;;; 2009.08.13 Dan
;;;             : * Added an optional parameter to chunks-similarity to control
;;;             :   whether or not the activation trace info is displayed since
;;;             :   it can also be called by the user in which case the trace
;;;             :   is undesirelable (and since it's model output can't be shut
;;;             :   off with no-output).
;;; 2009.09.09 Dan
;;;             : * With the addition of the multi-buffers and buffer sets DM
;;;             :   needs to flag any chunk it has as invalid for use in such a
;;;             :   set to avoid unintentional modification of DM chunks.
;;; 2010.08.30 Dan
;;;             : * Extending the :act parameter to take a level like trace-detail
;;;             :   so one can get a smaller set of info when desired.  High is
;;;             :   the same as t and nil is still off.  Medium turns off all of
;;;             :   the "doesn't match" indicators but otherwise shows everything
;;;             :   and low only shows the total activation.
;;; 2011.02.09 Dan
;;;             : * Added a merge-dm command which works like add-dm except that
;;;             :   the chunks are merged in as if cleared from a buffer at the
;;;             :   current time.  It merges them in an order that guarantees 
;;;             :   any chunks used in slots of other chunks get merged first,
;;;             :   but if there are circularities it just does them in the 
;;;             :   order provided.
;;; 2011.04.25 Dan
;;;             : * Added an ignore declaration to the secondary reset to
;;;             :   avoid a warning at load time.
;;;             : * Updated the time values to be milliseconds internally, but
;;;             :   still use seconds for 'user' interaction.
;;; 2011.04.26 Dan
;;;             : * Switched the finsts to use the ms time as well.
;;;             : * Added a check for negative time deltas when computing 
;;;             :   activations with :ol # because that could lead to complex
;;;             :   results.
;;; 2011.04.28 Dan
;;;             : * Suppress the warnings about redefining functions when 
;;;             :   adding the chunk parameters.
;;; 2011.06.22 Dan
;;;             : * Added the :sact parameter which allows the activation
;;;             :   trace info to be saved and all the necessary support to
;;;             :   actually save that info.
;;; 2011.06.23 Dan
;;;             : * Added dummy sact-trace structs before and after a retrieval
;;;             :   so other activation info doesn't overwrite the saved data.
;;;             : * Changed it so that it now stores arbitrary activation 
;;;             :   computations along with retrieval requests.
;;; 2011.07.17 Dan [1.2]
;;;             : * Added a crude retrieval buffer stuffing mechanism.
;;;             :   Setting the :declarative-stuffing parameter to a number
;;;             :   will enable the mechanism.  At time 0 and then when ever
;;;             :   the module is not busy and either:
;;;             :   - the retrieval buffer empties
;;;             :   - :declarative-stuffing seconds pass since a stuffed 
;;;             :     chunk was placed into the buffer
;;;             :   a new stuffing attempt will be performed.  
;;;             :   The stuffed chunk will be the chunk with the highest activation
;;;             :   among all chunks in DM. 
;;;             :   For now there is no attempt to be efficient about the 
;;;             :   process so it will recompute all the activations of all
;;;             :   chunks each time there is a stuffing attempt.  It will not
;;;             :   overwrite a requested chunk, nor will it ever terminate an
;;;             :   ongoing requested retrieval.
;;; 2011.09.12 Dan 
;;;             : * Took some unused variables out of check-declarative-stuffing
;;;             :   to eliminate some warnings.
;;; 2012.01.27 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the activation trace so that it also shows the non-
;;;             :   matching chunks under the high detail trace when partial
;;;             :   matching is enabled.
;;; 2012.02.03 Dan
;;;             : * Added the new command remove-old-dm-finsts because there are
;;;             :   a few places that happens and this is better than having the
;;;             :   code to do it there everytime.
;;; 2012.02.06 Dan
;;;             : * Added a dummy dm-current-sact-chunk at reset time because
;;;             :   things like set-base-levels force an activation calculation
;;;             :   indirectly at load time and it needs some place to 'save'
;;;             :   those values (though they're not really saved).
;;; 2012.02.21 Dan
;;;             : * Removed some debugging output from sort-for-binding-dm.
;;; 2012.04.19 Dan [1.3]
;;;             : * Added a new request parameter for retrievals :mp-value.
;;;             :   It can take the same values as the :mp parameter and if
;;;             :   provided will temporarily override the current :mp setting
;;;             :   for this retrieval request if :mp has already been enabled 
;;;             :   i.e. it can't temporarily turn on partial matching but can 
;;;             :   temporarily turn it off.
;;;             : * Changed it so that when an invalid request terminates a
;;;             :   retrieval the module goes back to free instead of staying
;;;             :   stuck at busy.
;;; 2012.08.06 Dan
;;;             : * Added a new parameter :nsji which controls whether or not
;;;             :   the Sji values are allowed to go negative from the S-log(fan)
;;;             :   calculation.  Possible values are t (meaning let them) or
;;;             :   nil which will prevent them and also display a model warning
;;;             :   when such a situation occurs.
;;; 2013.04.17 Dan
;;;             : * Added the last-request slot to the module and use that to
;;;             :   record the time and chunk-spec of the most recent request
;;;             :   to support the new whynot-dm command.
;;; 2013.05.21 Dan
;;;             : * Allow the :mp-value parameter to enable partial matching
;;;             :   when it is off and removed :mp from the parameters that warn
;;;             :   about being changed on the fly.
;;; 2013.09.05 Dan
;;;             : * Changed :nsji to take 3 possible values: t, nil, and warn.
;;;             :   T works as before to allow negative sji values, warn works
;;;             :   the way nil used to, cap values at 0 and print a warning,
;;;             :   and nil now caps the value at 0 and doesn't print the warning.
;;;             :   The new default is warn.
;;; 2013.10.09 Dan
;;;             : * Warn if :bll is set to >=1 if :ol is enabled (can't test 
;;;             :   for it in the valid function because that would require
;;;             :   calling sgp to test :ol which may or may not be set when 
;;;             :   a model is created since :bll could go before :ol).
;;; 2014.03.06 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Make the changes necessary to work with the now typeless
;;;             :   chunks.
;;; 2014.03.17 Dan 
;;;             : * Changed the query-buffer call to be consistent with the new
;;;             :   internal code.
;;; 2014.03.21 Dan
;;;             : * Use the common circular-references function from misc-utils.
;;; 2014.04.01 Dan
;;;             : * Used slots-vector-match-signature instead of doing the bit
;;;             :   tests directly.
;;; 2014.06.16 Dan
;;;             : * Changed how the initial chunk list in a request is created
;;;             :   so that it doesn't have to walk the list twice.
;;; 2014.08.28 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in start-retrieval when the request had modifiers
;;;             :   other than - and =.
;;; 2014.10.24 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the :pm parameter since it was depricated in 6.0.
;;; 2015.03.20 Dan
;;;             : * Failures now set the buffer failure flag using set-buffer-failure.
;;; 2015.06.04 Dan
;;;             : * Use safe-seconds->ms when setting :declarative-finst-span.
;;;             : * Use :time-in-ms t for all scheduled events.
;;; 2015.06.05 Dan
;;;             : * Compute-activation-latency now returns a time in ms and the
;;;             :   :lf parameter is stored as a ms value internally (it does
;;;             :   the scaling).
;;; 2015.06.08 Dan
;;;             : * When computing activations don't convert the references
;;;             :   to seconds, just scale it at the end using a value computed
;;;             :   when :bll gets set and stored in dm-act-scale.
;;;             : * When printing the activation trace print the times accurately
;;;             :   using print-time-in-seconds and store the ms values in the
;;;             :   saved structure.
;;;             : * The saved activation trace info is recorded at the ms time not
;;;             :   seconds.
;;; 2015.06.09 Dan
;;;             : * Record last-request time in ms.
;;; 2015.07.28 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the logical to ACT-R-support in the require-compiled.
;;; 2015.09.15 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Module now has a trackable buffer for use with the new 
;;;             :   utility learning mechanism and reports when requests are
;;;             :   finished with complete-request.
;;; 2016.06.30 Dan
;;;             : * Added an optional parameter to add-chunk-into-dm so that 
;;;             :   merge-chunk-into-dm can pass the key in since that can be
;;;             :   costly to create.
;;; 2016.09.01 Dan
;;;             : * The activation trace didn't actually print the chunk name when
;;;             :   the retrieval set hook forced an override.
;;; 2017.02.15 Dan [4.0]
;;;             : * Allow the sim-hook to be set to a string and use the dispatch-
;;;             :   apply function to call it so it can go out to an external
;;;             :   system if necessary.
;;;             : * Add a remote version of add-dm.
;;; 2017.02.17 Dan
;;;             : * Sim-hook test is now local-or-remote-function-or-nil.
;;; 2017.03.15 Dan [5.0]
;;;             : * Cache-sim-hook-results parameter added which adds a hash-table
;;;             :   for lookup of values returned by the sim-hook used before 
;;;             :   calling the hook-fn when enabled.  Helps a lot when the 
;;;             :   function returns consistent values and gets called through
;;;             :   the dispatcher.
;;; 2017.08.03 Dan [5.1]
;;;             : * Adding locks to make it all thread safe with the direct
;;;             :   approach of protecting the chunk table and the parameters.
;;;             :   May need to reconsider that based on performance.
;;; 2017.08.08 Dan
;;;             : * Also need a lock for the 'state' of the module which covers
;;;             :   the slots not related to chunks or params.  This should 
;;;             :   finish the thread safety.
;;; 2017.08.09 Dan
;;;             : * Update the buffer-status function to return the string.
;;; 2017.09.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added all-dm-chunk-types function for use by the environment.
;;; 2017.09.22 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed some bugs in the code that saves the activation trace.
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with parameter for the retrieval-set-hook fns.
;;; 2017.11.07 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the warning for :sim-hook to specify the string needs
;;;             :   to name a command.
;;; 2017.12.06 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the doc strings for the remote add-dm commands.
;;; 2018.01.26 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the buffer-status function to omit the extra newline.
;;; 2018.04.17 Dan [6.0]
;;;             : * Allow all the hook parameters to be dispatched commands.
;;; 2018.04.18 Dan
;;;             : * Convert the chunk-specs to ids for the hooks that use them.
;;;             : * Sjis are now stored as 2 element lists instead of conses.
;;;             : * Similarities are now also lists instead of conses.
;;; 2018.04.25 Dan
;;;             : * Added remote merge-dm.
;;; 2018.06.12 Dan
;;;             : * Have the external add/merge -dm commands do the string
;;;             :   processing since define-chunks won't.
;;; 2018.06.27 Dan [6.1]
;;;             : * Fix a bug that's been around for a long time with merging
;;;             :   into DM being case sensitive for strings whereas all other
;;;             :   chunk matching is case insensitive (including the general
;;;             :   merging action).
;;; 2018.07.26 Dan [6.2]
;;;             : * Removing the request completion support.
;;; 2018.08.24 Dan [6.3]
;;;             : * Added the add-dm-chunks{-fct} and merge-... commands which
;;;             :   take chunk names for adding or merging instead of definitions.
;;; 2019.01.25 Dan
;;;             : * Move the (setf (chunk-source-spread chunk) ...) inside of
;;;             :   the if since it defaults to 0 thus no need to keep setting
;;;             :   it there if spreading-activation is off and that's a parameter
;;;             :   which shouldn't change during a run.
;;; 2019.04.02 Dan
;;;             : * Have hash-chunk-contents use the underlying chunk info 
;;;             :   instead of going through the accessors.
;;; 2019.04.04 Dan
;;;             : * Cache the result of chunk-spec-slots in the retrieval
;;;             :   request since that's costly don't want to do it twice.
;;; 2019.04.15 Dan
;;;             : * Depend on splice-into-position-des being destructive and 
;;;             :   don't setf with the returned value.
;;; 2019.05.17 Dan [6.4]
;;;             : * Allow the sim-hook cache to persist across a reset.  Only
;;;             :   clear the table when a new hook function is set.
;;; 2019.08.15 Dan 
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with recording the matching chunks for the 
;;;             :   retrieval-set-hook and whynot-dm if :esc is nil.
;;; 2019.10.22 Dan
;;;             : * Merge-reference-list was using the chunk-lock instead
;;;             :   of the param-lock to protect access to the dm-ol value.
;;; 2020.01.10 Dan [6.5]
;;;             : * Removed the #' and lambdas from the module interface 
;;;             :   functions since that's not allowed in the general system
;;;             :   now.
;;;             : * Use set-or-remove-hook-parameter for all the hook parameters.
;;; 2020.02.12 Dan
;;;             : * Add tests to the parameter functions for reference-list and
;;;             :   permanent-noise so that they verify that the declarative
;;;             :   module is the one expected.
;;; 2020.04.21 Dan [6.6]
;;;             : * Added the :ignore-buffers parameter which allows one to
;;;             :   specify buffers whose contents doesn't need to be stored in
;;;             :   DM for efficiency.
;;; 2020.08.26 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the path for require-compiled since it's not needed
;;;             :   and results in warnings in SBCL.
;;; 2020.09.04 Dan
;;;             : * Use the merge-value-function for fan-out, reference-list,
;;;             :   and reference-count to avoid needing to get the values (also
;;;             :   makes the reference-* fns useable for other parameters).
;;; 2020.10.26 Dan [6.7]
;;;             : * Added an :rt-value request parameter that can be used to set
;;;             :   a new :rt value to use during this retrieval, just like the
;;;             :   :mp-value changes the :mp parameter.

;;;
;;; General Docs:
;;; 
;;; The declarative memory module has one buffer called retrieval.
;;;
;;; The declarative memory module collects the chunks that have been cleared
;;; from all buffers.  It merges newly cleared chunks with those that have been
;;; previously cleared.  This set of chunks is refered to as the declarative
;;; memory (DM for short).  Requests to the declarative module are attempts to
;;; find a chunk in DM which matches the request.  If such a chunk is found
;;; it is placed into the retrieval buffer.  If no such chunk is found, then
;;; it reports an error state.  It can only process one request at a time.  If
;;; a new request comes in prior to the completion of a previous request the
;;; older request is terminated immediately. The timing of a request's
;;; completion along with how the matching chunk is found are controled by
;;; several parameters and the following equations:
;;;
;;;
;;; In addition, to that, there are three request parameters which may be used -
;;; :recently-retrieved, :mp-value, and :rt-value.  
;;; :recently-retrieved  may be passed a value of t or nil.  The declarative
;;; memory module records which chunks it has returned as the result of a
;;; request and the recently-retrieved request parameter may be used to exclude
;;; chunks based on that information.  There are two parameters that control
;;; how the recently-retrieved designation occurs.  The :dm-finsts parameter
;;; indicates how many chunks will be marked as recently-retrieved and the
;;; :dm-finsts-decay parameter indicates for how many seconds each of those
;;; designations will persist.
;;; :mp-value can be used to temporarily change the setting of the :mp parameter
;;; while the request is processed.  :mp-value can be used whether the :mp 
;;; parameter has been enabled for the model or not i.e. it can temporarily
;;; enable partial matching even if it is off.
;;; :rt-value can be used to temporarily change the setting of the :rt parameter
;;; while the request is processed.
;;;
;;; The declarative memory module does not support buffer modification requests.
;;;
;;; The declarative memory module responds to the required queries as follows:
;;;
;;; State free will respond t if there is no request pending or nil if there is
;;;       i.e. the module is not free between the time of a request and when
;;;       the chunk from that request is placed into the buffer.
;;; State busy will respond t if there is a pending request and nil if not.
;;; State error will respond with t if no chunk matching the most recent request 
;;;       could be found or nil otherwise.  The error t will not be indicated 
;;;       until after the time for failure has passed.
;;; Buffer requested will be t if the chunk in the buffer is the result of a request 
;;;       and nil if it is the result of the buffer stuffing mechanism or the 
;;;       buffer is empty.
;;; Buffer unrequested will be t if the chunk in the buffer was put there by the
;;;       buffer stuffing mechanims and it will be nil if it is the result of a
;;;       retrieval request or the buffer is empty.

#|
Interesting note on spreading activation and the retrieval buffer.
Currently, the retrieval buffer will never be an active source of
activation because the buffer will clear before the request is made.
That is the desired current implementation - no buffers get treated
special and all production actions are allowed to occur before the
retrieval is attempted.

That may need to be revisited at some point, but for now parsimony
of operation is more important.
