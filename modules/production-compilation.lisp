;;; Description : Implements the production compilation mechnaism in ACT-R 6.
;;; 
;;; Bugs        : 
;;;
;;; To do       : [X] Consider the handling of !safe-bind! in respect to doing
;;;             :     a direct substitution with the instantiated binding.
;;;             : [X] With the addition of the compilation-instan parameter
;;;             :     it may be possible to put the goal style slot remapping
;;;             :     back into the goal mapping function instead of directly
;;;             :     in the composition function, and then remove the clean-up
;;;             :     hack at the end.  Not entirely sure, but definitely worth
;;;             :     investigating at some point.
;;;             : [X v5.0] Consider whether dynamic slots which are used between
;;;             :     two productions (the pre-instantiate case) could remain
;;;             :     dynamic by only instantiating for the mapping.  Probably
;;;             :     leaves a lot of loose ends, but there are some notes in
;;;             :     the docs/notes/production-compilation-issues directory.
;;; ----- History -----
;;; 2005.04.26 Dan
;;;             : * Initial creation.
;;;
;;; 2005.05.18 Dan
;;;             : * Works to compose now, but doesn't yet have the parameter
;;;             :   learning pieces.
;;; 2005.05.19 Dan
;;;             : * Note that productions generated by compilation are 
;;;             :   created with p* because p*'s are a super set of p's
;;;             :   and that way p*'s can go through compilation without 
;;;             :   any special handling!
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the composing functions because if a
;;;             :   buffer isn't mentioned in the first production it doesn't
;;;             :   actually have an index of 0.
;;;             : * Added the utility equation pieces, so it should be "fully"
;;;             :   operational (noting that it isn't defined if parameter
;;;             :   learning is set to use a decay value).
;;; 2005.05.20 Dan
;;;             : * Adding the threshold-time parameter.
;;; 2005.05.24 Dan
;;;             : * Some general clean up for speed and ease of reading for
;;;             :   the newly formed productions.
;;; 2005.05.25 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue in compose-productions where ACL was letting
;;;             :   me get away with some sloppy code.
;;; 2005.05.26 Dan
;;;             : * Some more minor clean up for ease of reading the
;;;             :   the new productions - take out all = slot modifiers and
;;;             :   order the conditions as buffer tests, buffer queries, and
;;;             :   then !'s with the tests and queries in alphabetical order
;;;             :   by buffer name.
;;; 2005.05.27 Dan
;;;             : * Make sure that the compilation is disabled on a reset.
;;;             : * Added the initial-successes, initial-failures, and initial-
;;;             :   efforts parameters.
;;; 2005.06.01 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in compilation under MCL buffer-condition-
;;;             :   union was trying to set the second of something that was
;;;             :   nil which isn't a good idea, but didn't break in ACL though
;;;             :   I don't know why.
;;;             : * Ammended the tests for a valid production to include not 
;;;             :   having any direct requests and not using any slot modifiers
;;;             :   other than = for now.
;;; 2005.06.02 Dan
;;;             : * Some minor updates. 
;;;             : * Need to check that production name isn't already used 
;;;             :   explicitly since new-name only checks chunk names.
;;;             : * The test for slot modifiers needs to not look at evals and
;;;             :   binds because they may have similar structure...
;;; 2005.06.06 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in buffer-condition-union because it could be
;;;             :   the case that the first condition is blank and thus one
;;;             :   can't delete the isa from the second in that case.
;;; 2005.06.08 Dan
;;;             : * Changed define-chunk-spec-fct to define-variable-chunk-
;;;             :   spec-fct in produce-standard-representation because 
;;;             :   otherwise it blocks p*'s from being composed.  Since the
;;;             :   chunk-spec wasn't being use other than to order the
;;;             :   production components it shouldn't create any problems...
;;; 2005.06.16 Dan
;;;             ; * Fixed a bug in compose-productions with respect to
;;;             :   !safe-bind! because it wasn't properly copying all the
;;;             :   necessary pieces into the newly composed production.
;;;             : * Changed compose-productions so that it correctly orders
;;;             :   RHS safe-binds because the p2 bindings may depend on the
;;;             :   bindings of p1.  It also now checks to make sure that a
;;;             :   new production gets created without error to revent it 
;;;             :   from just crashing if that happens for some reason.
;;; 2005.08.15 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in that the hooks weren't removed if epl was
;;;             :   toggled from t to nil.  Thus, prior to this fix the only
;;;             :   way to disable was a reset once it was enabled.
;;; 2005.08.16 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed problems with the handling of !safe-bind! on the RHS.
;;;             :   The issues were if the substitution resulted in the var
;;;             :   being bound mapping onto a constant or if the var being
;;;             :   bound ends up on the LHS of the composed production after
;;;             :   mapping.  The solution (for now) is to convert those to
;;;             :   LHS !safe-eval! tests on the value in question instead.
;;;             : - Another potential solution is to treat !safe-bind! actions
;;;             :   like retrievals and just do the constant substitution with
;;;             :   the instantiated value.
;;;             : * Another situation with binds popped up - a RHS bind + a
;;;             :   LHS eval can result in an odd combination with an unbound
;;;             :   variable, so to fix that there's currently a fix to move
;;;             :   the bind to the LHS.  That then makes the new production
;;;             :   a dead end for compilation, but doesn't cause the system
;;;             :   to crash.
;;; 2005.08.17 Dan
;;;             : * Major change in how !safe-bind! is handled!
;;;             :   Now, instead of trying to catch all the gotchas, a RHS
;;;             :   binding in the first production will be treated like a
;;;             :   retrieval for substitution - the explicit value bound
;;;             :   in the instantiation will be propigated forward into the
;;;             :   new production and the form that was evaluated will be
;;;             :   discarded.
;;;             :   That means that there should be no side effects in the
;;;             :   evaluation of a !safe-bind! because they will not be
;;;             :   carried over to a compiled production!
;;; 2005.08.19 Dan
;;;             : * Continuing to update how binds work.  Not only will the
;;;             :   value of the bound variable be captured, but all variables
;;;             :   that are referenced in the bind expression will be replaced
;;;             :   with their instantiated values from the first production.
;;; 2005.08.22 Dan
;;;             : * More work on the mechanism.  Now, adding a (somewhat)
;;;             :   redundant check to make sure productions are compatible.
;;;             :   This check ensures that a buffer doesn't violate the
;;;             :   assumptions that underlie the style - for instance that
;;;             :   the goal chunk doesn't change other than through a
;;;             :   production.
;;;             :   Right now it's only a check of goal style buffers because
;;;             :   we want partial matching (which may be inconsistent) for
;;;             :   retrieval style buffers and motor and perceptual buffers
;;;             :   don't compile across modifications or requests to begin
;;;             :   with.  This needs to be made more general though so that
;;;             :   it also can be user extended.
;;; 2005.09.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added a call to with-unchecked-p* around the generation of
;;;             :   the new production to allow non-variable new slot creation
;;;             :   (which could happen after substitution in a generated
;;;             :   production).
;;; 2005.09.02 Dan
;;;             : * Patch work to fix issues with p* in general that were
;;;             :   uncovered while testing the slot creation code.
;;;             :   Main issue is that modifications in the first production
;;;             :   need to have the slot names instantiated so that all the
;;;             :   conditions of the second that were set by the first can
;;;             :   be detected.
;;;             : * Since only goal style modules allow buffer modification,
;;;             :   that's where I've applied the fix, but if other styles are
;;;             :   to allow mods then that will have to be handled there too.
;;; 2005.11.09 Dan
;;;             : * Fix for a problem in composing a p1 that makes a retrieval
;;;             :   request with a p2 that doesn't mention retrieval at all.
;;;             :   The request was being dropped, but shouldn't have been.
;;; 2005.12.12 Dan
;;;             : * Temporary fix to composing p* variablized slots (instead of
;;;             :   just instantiating them).  This is a hack John put in and
;;;             :   I'm working on making it more general.
;;; 2005.12.14 Dan
;;;             : * Moved the fix into the goal-style buffers explicitly since
;;;             :   they're the only ones where it's an issue because none of
;;;             :   the other styles allow for a RHS modification.
;;; 2005.12.15 Dan
;;;             : * Realized that I can't do it in the goal buffer processing
;;;             :   because the "normal" variable mapping process needs the
;;;             :   change before it progresses (which occurs before it goes
;;;             :   to the buffer specific code).  So, it's in the main 
;;;             :   function and conditionalized to only occur for the special
;;;             :   case necessary (goal style buffer with a RHS modification).
;;; 2005.12.20 Dan
;;;             : * Minor changes to clean up some compiler warnings.
;;; 2006.01.17 Dan
;;;             : * Time to change the version number and module info text.
;;;             :   It's now version 1.0.
;;; 2006.02.03 Dan
;;;             : * Another issue with p*'s that I don't really have a good
;;;             :   handle on at this point (see pstar-test8.lisp in the test-
;;;             :   models folder for an example).  So, for now I've taken the
;;;             :   easiest approach and just clean-up after the fact.  Which
;;;             :   might be a good idea in general, but doesn't feel quite
;;;             :   right...
;;; 2006.02.07 Dan
;;;             : * Make sure that the RHS !safe-bind! calls in p2 come before the
;;;             :   !safe-eval! and !output! calls in p3 to avoid issues with
;;;             :   unbound vars.  Maintaining original order might be a nice
;;;             :   thing to have, but the "standard rep" loses that at this 
;;;             :   point to allow for better comparisons.  So, if that's really
;;;             :   necessary it'll require some more extensive changes.
;;; 2006.03.10 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed calls to get-production because it no longer requires
;;;             :   the procedural module as a parameter.
;;;             : * Removed the learned-productions slot of the module and
;;;             :   instead made it a parameter on the productions themselves.
;;;             : * Updated update-params-for-compiled-production to not do
;;;             :   the utility computation, but instead to call the functions
;;;             :   in the utility-and-reward file.
;;; 2006.03.13 Dan
;;;             : * Removed all the utility parameters from the compilation
;;;             :   module because they're now part of the utility module.
;;; 2006.03.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug that was introduced with the !safe-bind! fix
;;;             :   that caused RHS buffer references to be instantiated.
;;; 2006.03.14 Dan
;;;             : * Switched call to pp to (all-productions).
;;; 2006.07.12 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the typo in the documentation of the :pct parameter.
;;; 2006.08.29 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in compose-productions where it was creating
;;;             :   the comment string for the new production.  It was iterating
;;;             :   over all buffers to determine if any were "removed" which
;;;             :   would throw a warning for a buffer that wasn't used now.
;;;             :   Instead, it only needs to check the buffers actually used
;;;             :   on the LHS of p2 which avoids the bug and is generally 
;;;             :   going to save a little time during compilation.
;;; 2006.09.07 Dan
;;;             : * Changed reset-production-compilation so that imaginal is
;;;             :   a goal type by default.
;;; 2006.11.10 Dan
;;;             : * Use the new dynamic slot of productions so that compilation
;;;             :   only creates p*s when a parent production is a p*.
;;; 2006.11.16 Dan
;;;             : * Changed update-params-for-compiled-production so that when
;;;             :   it deletes the new productions it also releases the name
;;;             :   symbol using release-name.
;;; 2006.11.17 Dan
;;;             : * Added a compilation-buffer-type macro and renamed the
;;;             :   function with -fct.
;;;             : * Added a call to values around the gethash in compilation-
;;;             :   buffer-type to suppress the second return value.
;;;             : * Changed specify-compilation-buffer-type to return t/nil only.
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in specify-compilation-buffer-type because it
;;;             :   was missing parameters in the calls to print-warning.
;;; 2007.01.15 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug that was introduced with the change on 11/16
;;;             :   that would break when releasing the name.
;;; 2007.02.01 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the instantiating necessary when a goal
;;;             :   style buffer in a p* modifies a chunk with a variablized
;;;             :   slot, or after any modification the p2 has a variablized
;;;             :   condition test.  Previously it only instantiated if both
;;;             :   cases where satisfied instead of either which could lead
;;;             :   to "incorrect" productions.  Probably a pretty rare situation,
;;;             :   since p*'s and production compilation are both sparsely 
;;;             :   used so I'm guessing that this hasn't been an issue for 
;;;             :   anyone else. (John didn't even encounter it!)
;;; 2007.04.10 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the comment string added to the new production so
;;;             :   that it only indicates the '- chunk' when the first production
;;;             :   actually made a request to the retrieval type buffer which
;;;             :   was matched in the second.  Previously, as long as the
;;;             :   second production tested such a buffer it would add that
;;;             :   to the comment.
;;;             : * Fixed a bad bug in compose-retrieval-buffer.  If p1 had
;;;             :   a retrieval request and p2 had a query of that buffer without
;;;             :   a harvest (thus it must be state busy or buffer empty) then
;;;             :   the composed production actually dropped the request from
;;;             :   the actions as if it was harvested!
;;;             : * Added a fix for an issue with retrieval drop-out when
;;;             :   the request had dynamic slot names.  There are still
;;;             :   a couple of issues to work out, but this should catch
;;;             :   many of the current problem cases.
;;; 2007.04.11 Dan
;;;             : * Added a better check for whether a compiled production is
;;;             :   dynamic and should be created with p* instead of just assuming
;;;             :   that it was based on the parents.
;;;             : * Added a new parameter to productions: compilation-instan.
;;;             :   It's used to hold the instantiation of p2 during compilation 
;;;             :   which is the bindings from the matching of p2 where some of the
;;;             :   variables may have been renamed to avoid conflicts with the 
;;;             :   variables from p1.
;;;             : * Using that new parameter, fixed a bug in the drop-out of
;;;             :   a retrieval which involved dynamic slots that had been renamed
;;;             :   in p2.
;;; 2007.05.21 Dan
;;;             : * Fix a bug that surprised me because nobody had found it yet -
;;;             :   when compiling out a retrieval if p2 used the "dropped" buffer
;;;             :   variable on the RHS it wasn't instantiated.  Not as easy a 
;;;             :   fix as first thought either because p1 could use that variable
;;;             :   name on it's LHS or RHS and those shouldn't be replaced...
;;;             : * Required adding the new production parameter retrieval-buffers-map
;;;             :   to keep things straight (sort of a hack, but I think it works
;;;             :   out ok).
;;; 2007.05.22 Dan
;;;             : * Similar to the bug listed above, compilation over goal style buffers
;;;             :   is allowed to progress (or fails with a warning in some cases)
;;;             :   when there is a use of the buffer variable in the actions of
;;;             :   p2 but a request in p1 invalidates that for the compiled production.
;;;             :   Updated the spreadsheet/data table to add a check for that.
;;; 2007.07.03 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed check-consistency because it was overly specific in
;;;             :   testing that things matched.  Replaced the eq test of the
;;;             :   slot contents with chunk-slot-equal.
;;; 2007.10.26 Dan [1.3]
;;;             : * Sorting the actions in the composed productions so that
;;;             :   the "same" production gets created in all systems.  Otherwise
;;;             :   they can vary in the action order which shouldn't matter, but
;;;             :   for some rare situations might.
;;; 2008.03.20 Dan
;;;             : * Putting in a test so that productions with multiple-value binds 
;;;             :   are always rejected from compilation.
;;; 2008.12.23 Dan
;;;             : * Put in code to make sure that new productions get added to
;;;             :   the procedural module the "right" way now.
;;; 2009.08.27 Dan
;;;             : * Added code to disable the consistency check between the
;;;             :   RHS modifications of p1 and the LHS tests of p2 for goal
;;;             :   style buffers when ppm is enabled.
;;; 2009.09.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the consistency check added for the ppm change.
;;; 2010.11.22 Dan [1.4]
;;;             : * Start of the changes to update this to allow for buffer
;;;             :   modification requests, create a new type for imaginal,
;;;             :   and make things more easily extendable.
;;;             : * First pass is just the ability for get-buffer-index to
;;;             :   distinguish a normal request from a modification request
;;;             :   with modification requests just adding another bit to the
;;;             :   numbers.
;;;             : * Updated the docs to describe things a little better with
;;;             :   respect to the spreadsheets which are involved and are
;;;             :   how they are going to be used in the new implementation.
;;; 2010.11.23 Dan
;;;             : * Updated valid-1st-p to allow for both a modification and
;;;             :   standard request in a single production.
;;; 2010.11.24 Dan
;;;             : * Replaced the separate tables with a single table that
;;;             :   holds structures with a type's info.
;;; 2010.11.29 Dan
;;;             : * Don't like mixing changes, but in addition to updates for
;;;             :   the new more flexible compilation type handling I've added
;;;             :   some pre-caching of things that can take a while to compute
;;;             :   and are likely to be computed often: valid-1st-p, valid-for-
;;;             :   compilation, and a table for testing whether two productions
;;;             :   are composeable.
;;; 2010.12.06 Dan
;;;             : * Finished off the generalizing and moved all the buffer type
;;;             :   specific code to the corresponding files in the tools 
;;;             :   directory.  
;;;             : * Still need to clean up the details for the specifics of
;;;             :   handling the modification requests in those specific files.
;;; 2010.12.07 Dan
;;;             : * Changed update-params-... so that when :pct is on the
;;;             :   production is printed through print-production directly
;;;             :   instead of pp so that I can send it to the model trace 
;;;             :   instead of the command trace.
;;; 2010.12.15 Dan
;;;             : * Added the module as the first parameter passed to the 
;;;             :   mapping function.
;;; 2010.12.17 Dan
;;;             : * Added a new test to valid-compilation-production to check
;;;             :   for redundant variable usage.  It won't stop compilation,
;;;             :   but will print a warning if such useage is found.
;;; 2010.12.20 Dan
;;;             : * Allow the consistency check to pass for chunks of a subtype
;;;             :   in either direction between the two if specified in the
;;;             :   test.
;;; 2011.04.26 Dan
;;;             : * Use the millisecond times internally.
;;; 2011.04.28 Dan
;;;             : * Added some declaims and declares to avoid compiler warnings.
;;;             : * Suppress warnings about extending productions at initial load.
;;; 2011.08.23 Dan
;;;             : * Changed how get-buffer-index handles a direct request so that
;;;             :   they may to a + instead of a * for the validity table.  Doesn't
;;;             :   affect anything for compilation since productions with 
;;;             :   direct requests get pruned as invalid for compilation, but
;;;             :   other code which may use that index might care.
;;; 2011.09.13 Dan
;;;             : * Removed an errant debugging print out.
;;; 2012.04.04 Dan [1.5]
;;;             : * Added more detail to the compilation trace.  It now includes
;;;             :   a description of why a production was not valid for compilation
;;;             :   and will display the details reported by a buffer type if it
;;;             :   reports any.  A compilation type now has to specify whether
;;;             :   it has a whynot reason function which is the 9th parameter
;;;             :   passed to define-compilation-type.  If a whynot-reason function 
;;;             :   is specified it will be called with 3 parameters -- the p1 index
;;;             :   the p2 index and either the name of a test function which failed
;;;             :   or nil if no test function was called.
;;; 2012.11.20 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with how the comment string for the compiled production
;;;             :   was set when there's a dropout buffer which only occurs in the
;;;             :   conditions of the second production.
;;; 2014.05.07 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Start the conversion to the typeless chunk operation and
;;;             :   the modified production syntax.
;;; 2014.05.19 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the allow-subtypes keyword from check-consistency.
;;; 2015.06.04 Dan
;;;             : * Use safe-seconds->ms for recording the :tt value.
;;; 2015.07.28 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the logical in build-compilation-type-file to ACT-R.
;;; 2016.06.10 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with these two productions being considered
;;;             :   equivalent:
;;;             :    (p STEP3 =GOAL> ISA GOAL STEP 3 ==> =GOAL> STEP 1)
;;;             :    (p PRODUCTION0 =GOAL> isa goal STEP 1 ==> =GOAL> STEP 3)
;;;             :   Which happens because the isa goal isn't a part of the 
;;;             :   standard representation now so it ends up matching the lhs
;;;             :   of one to the rhs of the other and vice-versa.  
;;;             :   Equivalent-productions-p now tests lhs and rhs separately to
;;;             :   avoid that.
;;; 2016.07.01 Dan
;;;             : * Removed some old code that's not used anymore.
;;;             : * Replaced remove-buffers with basic-variables which accesses
;;;             :   a value that's stored in a table of the compilation module
;;;             :   since there's a sizeable cost to recomputing that everytime
;;;             :   and making it a production parameter requires two hash-table
;;;             :   lookups instead of one.
;;;             : * Replaced the format in convert-cmd to a concatenate.
;;; 2016.09.28 Dan
;;;             : * Removed code that checks for multiple meta-processes from
;;;             :   define-compilation-type.
;;; 2017.08.11 Dan
;;;             : * Protect access to production structures right at the top
;;;             :   in compile-productions to avoid having to catch it everywhere
;;;             :   below that.
;;; 2018.04.17 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Add locks to protect the tables and the modules.
;;;             : * Add remote versions of the user commands.
;;; 2018.06.22 Dan
;;;             : * Only external commands need to convert names.
;;; 2020.04.24 Dan
;;;             : * Set style-check off when creating the composed production
;;;             :   to avoid checking (don't rely on delay-tree to do that now).
;;; 2020.05.01 Dan
;;;             : * Removed a check of use-tree as well since it's not needed. 
;;;             :   Sets the delay extra flag initially and then call add-
;;;             :   production-extra-setup when done so that all the details for
;;;             :   other code can stay in the procedural module.
;;; 2020.06.11 Dan
;;;             : * Fix a potential problem with equivalent-productions-p not 
;;;             :   considering two productions equivalent because their buffer-
;;;             :   indices values aren't in the same order.  Not a likely 
;;;             :   occurrence since if they're compiled productions then they'd
;;;             :   almost certainly have to have resulted in the same order,
;;;             :   but a starting production could have been written with the
;;;             :   buffer tests and actions ordered in such a way that the 
;;;             :   indices end up ordered differently.
;;; 2020.06.12 Dan
;;;             : * Keep a table of production "signatures" for testing with
;;;             :   equivalent-productions-p so don't always have to test all of
;;;             :   them.  Use the new :add-produciton-hook to store them in
;;;             :   the table.
;;; 2020.06.17 Dan [4.0]
;;;             : * Allow LHS safe-binds now, but disallow using safe-bind
;;;             :   vars in other safe-bind expressions to make it tractable to
;;;             :   determine equivalence (there are problems with the test that
;;;             :   existed prior to this for this and other reasons).
;;;             : * Changed the internal standard-representation so that it
;;;             :   isn't necessary to translate into and out of the buffer
;;;             :   variable symbol.
;;;             : * The pre-instantiate setting for a compilation type now needs
;;;             :   to be either t or nil.  It can't be a function to compute
;;;             :   whether to do so or not for consistency reasons.
;;; 2020.06.24 Dan
;;;             : * Added another lookup table for testing equivalence.  Store
;;;             :   composed productions in a table based on their documentation
;;;             :   and check those items first for equivalence since unless 
;;;             :   there are RHS !safe-binds! or ppm is enabled it should be a
;;;             :   match to what's there without having to check the more 
;;;             :   general table.
;;; 2020.06.25 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with !safe-bind! from p2 getting duplicated
;;;             :   in p3.
;;;             : * Marked the to do actions as done (not entirely sure I know
;;;             :   what the first referred to but seems like it's done now) and
;;;             :   the second was addressed a while ago.
;;; 2020.07.06 Dan
;;;             : * Added a declare ignorable to equivalent-productions-p to
;;;             :   avoid a compilation warning in single-threaded mode.
;;; 2020.07.22 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with a retrival drop-out trying to instantiate
;;;             :   the variable in a LHS !safe-bind! (the RHS ones are already
;;;             :   instantiated and dropped).
;;;             : * Turns out RHS p2 aren't dropped, but they should be ok now.
;;; 2020.11.04 Dan [4.1]
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with buffer name variables being renamed
;;;             :   when they occur in both productions.  This fix simply treats
;;;             :   buffer name variables which occur in the LHS of the 
;;;             :   production as not "basic variables" that will be renamed.
;;;             :   This seems to do the right thing for most of the error cases
;;;             :   that were found, but it does introduce some productions that
;;;             :   aren't right in subtle ways where previously it would have
;;;             :   failed to create a production because of the unbound vars.
;;;             :   The most significant of those relate to the buffer changing
;;;             :   due to a request between them which causes the buffer var
;;;             :   to have different values in the productions.  The current
;;;             :   plan for a fix to that is to just disallow their composition
;;;             :   which shouldn't break anything since before they would have
;;;             :   either created a "bad" production or failed to produce one
;;;             :   at all.  That's going to be a separate update once all of
;;;             :   the details are worked out.  That will still leave some very
;;;             :   obscure issues, mostly related to the fact that the 
;;;             :   imaignal-action buffer is a hidden !eval! which can do all
;;;             :   kinds of things to mess it up, but those are also issues now
;;;             :   anyway.
;;; 2020.11.05 Dan [4.2]
;;;             : * Prevent composition of two productions if p2 uses a buffer
;;;             :   variable on the LHS and there's a request for that buffer in 
;;;             :   the first production.
;;; 2020.11.09 Dan [4.3]
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with composing dynamic productions which was
;;;             :   broken with the 4.0 update.  Considered allowing a more
;;;             :   general solution that only instantiates for the mapping, but
;;;             :   not going to do so at this point.
;;; 2020.11.10 Dan [4.4]
;;;             : * Speculative attempt to allow productions with RHS indirect 
;;;             :   actions to be compiled.  It replaces the variable or chunk
;;;             :   with all the slots and values as is done for the action at
;;;             :   run time.  So, effectively it compiles the chunk into the
;;;             :   production much like dropping out the retrieval -- the 
;;;             :   composed production doesn't have any indirection.
;;;             : * Added a parameter, :cia (compile indirect actions) to enable
;;;             :   or disable that (disabled by default).
;;;             : * Split standard-rep into it's two parts (standard-rep and
;;;             :   composition-rep) and make those production parameters so the
;;;             :   locking protection is automatic (it wasn't being protected 
;;;             :   previously).  Also add standard-rep-sides to hold the lhs
;;;             :   and rhs pieces that are shared between the two.
;;; 2020.11.18 Dan [4.5]
;;;             : * Instantiate the LHS variable binding along with the RHS
;;;             :   actions, which requires checking whether any variables are
;;;             :   used in an indirect action are bound in a !safe-bind!.
;;;             : * Requires a test that indirect requests are valid chunks to
;;;             :   avoid creating an invalid production which means that
;;;             :   produce-composition-representation has to detect the issue
;;;             :   which happens now if it returns a string and that's tested
;;;             :   in compose-production.
;;;             : * Also added some code to investigate allowing retrieval style 
;;;             :   buffer actions from p2 to remain indirect, but that's not
;;;             :   a usable mechanism at this point.
;;; 2020.11.20 Dan 
;;;             : * Starting to use the :rir parameter to keep retreival style 
;;;             :   buffers' indirect actions indirect when possible (not usable
;;;             :   yet).
;;; 2020.11.24 Dan
;;;             : * I think this works for retaining the indirect requests where
;;;             :   possible when :rir is set and rejecting cases that can't be
;;;             :   composed (instantiating bind variables), but needs more 
;;;             :   testing to be certain.
;;; 2020.12.01 Dan [4.6]
;;;             : * More testing suggests :rir is stable, and with some minor
;;;             :   cleanup of the code it's being made available now.
;;; 2021.01.11 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with variabilized slots in actions which are
;;;             :   set with explicitly bound variables not properly creating
;;;             :   the new production.
;;; 2021.02.08 Dan
;;;             : * Fix a bug where removal of duplicate LHS safe-binds didn't
;;;             :   remap the variables in RHS safe-eval and output commands
;;;             :   that were added from p2.
;;; 2021.02.10 Dan [5.0]
;;;             : * Remove the pre-instantiation step and put that on the buffer
;;;             :   mechanisms to handle in the mapping and composing fns when
;;;             :   needed because it was preventing some desired generality and
;;;             :   didn't actually work "right" in some cases.
;;; 2021.02.19 Dan
;;;             : * When composing the buffer= and buffer+ actions need to 
;;;             :   exclude dynamic p1 slots whose instantiation is overridden
;;;             :   with something in p2 (which may also have been dynamic).
;;; 2021.10.18 Dan
;;;             : * Changed call to buffers to model-buffers instead in reset
;;;             :   function (other calls need to refer to all buffers).
;;; 2021.10.19 Dan [6.0]
;;;             : * Set the :required flag on the module to procedural.

;;; General Docs:
;;; 
;;; Specific details of the production compilation process can be found in the
;;; compilation.doc file in the docs/notes directory, but some general information

;;;
;;; The basic mechanism is that for any two productions that fire in sequence
;;; a new production may be created that is a composition of those two (typically
;;; referred to as "compiling" those productions).
;;;
;;; To determine whether two productions can be composed and how they get 
;;; composed depends on what buffers are used and how they are used.

;;; The test for valid-p is that it have none of the following:
;;;    - LHS !eval!
;;;    - LHS !bind!
;;;    - LHS !mv-bind!
;;;    - RHS !eval!
;;;    - RHS !bind!
;;;    - RHS !mv-bind!
;;;    - multiple LHS ='s for any one buffer.
;;;    - No indirect actions if :cia is set to nil
;;;    - No indirect actions for any buffer using a !safe-bind! variable if :cia is t and :rir is nil
;;;    - No indirect actions for all non-retrieval style buffers using a !safe-bind! variable if :cia is t and :rir is t  
;;;    - No overwrite actions
;;;    - No slot modifiers other than = in the conditions.
;;;    - No "nesting" of !safe-bind! variables i.e. using a
;;;      variable bound with safe-bind in the expression of
;;;      a different safe-bind on the same side of the production.
;;;   
;;;
;;; The test for valid-1st-p is that it have none of the following:
;;;    - RHS !stop!
;;;    - more than one action of a particular type for a specific buffer of any style
;;;      though it may have a single modification, a single request, and a single modification request
;;;      for each buffer
;;;
;;; The test of composable is a lot more involved. 
;;; 
;;; First, the productions must fire within the threshold time of each other.
;;; Then, for each buffer used in either production the composition charts
;;; are consulted to determine if its useage is composeable.  If all of the buffers are
;;; composeable given their usage, there is a check to ensure that the buffer actions 
;;; in the first are compatible with the conditions in the second to avoid any problems
;;; with an "unusual" change in the buffer.  The last check is to see there are any 
;;; buffers with a request in the first production and the use of that buffer's variable
;;; in the conditions of the second, and if so they can't be composed.
;;;
;;; The default composition process considers buffers to fall into one of 5 general
;;; types (goal, imaginal, retrieval, perceptual, and motor) and the mechanism differs
;;; based on the types of buffers used in the two productions.  The Microsoft 
;;; Excel file "compilation.xls" in the docs directory lays out the tables that
;;; govern the composabilty of productions based on the types of buffers
;;; used and the conditions and actions they contain.  
;;;
;;; Here's a guide for how to read those sheets.  The A1 cell holds the 
;;; name of the compilation buffer type being specified.  B1 holds
;;; the function to call for mapping of constants to variables between
;;; the two productions' buffer usage or nil if no such mapping is necessary.
;;; C1 holds the function to call for creating the conditions and actions for 
;;; that buffer in the new production.  Cell D1 holds the name of a function to call for
;;; performing any extra compatibility test necessary after composability
;;; has been determined for the productions, or the value nil if there is
;;; no additional test necessary for this type.  Cell E1 is no longer used.
;;; Cell F1 is t or nil to indicate whether a request-harvest pair of the buffer
;;; should be dropped out.  Cell G1 holds the name of a function to call to provide
;;; some details when this type blocked the composition of two productions.  Cell A2
;;; is a list of the buffers which will be set to this type, or the value :default if 
;;; this should be the default type for any unspecified buffers. 
;;;
;;; The table in rows 5-45 specifies the conditions under which the
;;; usage of this buffer type in the two productions can be composed.
;;; The rows are for buffer usage in the first production and the
;;; columns are for the buffer's usage in p2.  The number is a
;;; reference used internally for representing the condition which
;;; is displayed symbolically in the table.  There are 6 ways which the
;;; buffer may be used in a production:
;;; 
;;; LHS test: =
;;; LHS query: ?
;;; RHS modification: =
;;; RHS explicit clear: -
;;; RHS request: +
;;; RHS modification request: *
;;;
;;; In the symbolic representation the > is used to separate lhs and rhs
;;; usage, a "." separates items on the same side and empty brackets {}
;;; indicates no usage of the buffer on that side.  Order doesn't
;;; matter since the production testing is considered in parallel and
;;; actions have a fixed priority regardless of the order in the production.
;;; Thus, =>=.+.* is a production with a lhs test of the buffer and then
;;; a modification, a request, and a modification request on the RHS.
;;;
;;; The cells of the table indicate whether or not productions with those
;;; particular usages can be composed.  If it is nil then they can not be.
;;; If it is t then they can without restrictions, and if it is any other
;;; value that names a function to call to test some additional constraint
;;; which must be met to compose those productions.  The description of
;;; those functions' operations are described below the table along with
;;; some additional comments about this type of buffer.
;;;
;;; The text files saved from those spreadsheets are used directly to 
;;; generate the buffer composition files found in the tools directory.
;;; The idea is that if one wants to either modify or extend the compilation
;;; mechanism, then that can be done by changing or adding new spreadsheets
;;; and then rebuilding or adding the corresponding composition file instead of
;;; having to recode the whole thing.  That may require also adding some new
;;; testing functions or composition functions, but it should not require
;;; changing the code or mechanisms in this file.
;;;   
;;; The default assignment of buffers to types based on the current
;;; spreadsheets is as follows (assuming that a buffer by that name exists):
;;;
;;; Buffer name           Type
;;;  goal              goal
;;;  imaginal          imaginal
;;;  retrieval         retrieval
;;;  visual-location   perceptual
;;;  visual            perceptual
;;;  aural-location    perceptual
;;;  aural             perceptual
;;;  manual            motor
;;;  vocal             motor
;;; 
;;; The default type is motor, thus any other buffer will be assumed to be of 
;;; type motor unless configured using the specify-compilation-buffer-type 
;;; command (which can also be used to change the types for the default buffer 
;;; assignments).

;;;
;;; Public API:
;;; 
;;; defmacro specify-compilation-buffer-type (buffer-name buffer-type)
;;; defun   specify-compilation-buffer-type-fct (buffer-name buffer-type)
;;;
;;; buffer-name must be the name of a valid buffer in the model.
;;; buffer-type must be one of the symbols goal, imaginal, retrieval, perceptual, 
;;; motor, or the symbol naming another type which is created using 
;;; define-compilation-type.
;;;
;;; If the named buffer exists and the symbol for the buffer-type is valid this
;;; command will cause production compilation to treat the named buffer as a
;;; member of the specified type for composition purposes.
;;; 
;;; If the parameters are valid and there is a current production compilation
;;; module, then the command will return t otherwise it will print a warning 
;;; and return :error.
;;;
;;; If this command is to be used by a module to set its default type it
;;; should be done in the second module reset function.  If it is being set in
;;; the model, then it should occur within the body of the model.  Changing 
;;; the values at times other than reset or model creation are not advised and
;;; may lead to unpredictable behavior.
;;;
;;; defun show-compilation-buffer-types ()
;;;
;;; This command will print out a table showing the current compilation buffer
;;; type for each of the buffers in the system.  If there is no current module
;;; then it will print a warning.
;;; 
;;; It always returns nil.
;;;
;;; Parameters:
;;;   :cia - T or nil (default nil) set to t to allow compilation to occur for
;;;          productions which have indirect actions (those specified only by
;;;          a name)
;;;   :epl - T or nil (default nil) set to t to enable production learning 
;;;   :pct - T or nil (default nil) set to t to display details of the 
;;;          production compilation process in the trace
;;;   :rir - T or nil (default nil) set to t to have indirect retrieval style
;;;          buffer actions which stay in the production remain indirect 
;;;   :tt  - a positive number (default 2.0) threshold time in seconds which
;;;          productions must fire within to be valid for compiling

;;;
;;; Design Choices:
;;;
;;; Originally kept separate from the main procedural module as a precautionary
;;; measure while it was being developed, but now that separation seems like
;;; the right thing to do anyway to keep things clean.
;;;
;;; The dependence on and usage of the low-level production structure is not
;;; an ideal thing especially considering the option of extendability, but for
;;; now that's going to remain because it is convenient.

;;; that describe the types of buffer for composition to create.
;;;
;;; It will write out a file in the tools directory named {type-name}-compilation.lisp
;;; where {type-name} is the name specified for the type in the spreadsheet description.
;;;
;;; It also writes out empty definitions for the functions that need to be defined
;;; based on the specification given.
;;;
;;; For now those control functions will be passed low-level data types which aren't
;;; specified anywhere (the raw production structures, ugly list based production
;;; parses, and the compilation module instance).  Eventually, these interface functions
;;; will need to be passed something more appropriate and specified, but right now
;;; it's just a more distributed version of the current code.
