;;; Filename    : act-gui-interface.lisp
;;; Version     : 5.0
;;; 
;;; Description : Contains the functions that implement the abstract GUI
;;;             : interface used by the tutorial units and the misc functions
;;;             : that go with them (correlation and mean-deviation).  
;;;             : I'm calling it the ACT-R GUI interface (AGI) as suggested by Mike.
;;;             : It relies on the old UWI to handle the "real" interface to any
;;;             : particular windowing environment.
;;; Bugs        : 
;;; To Do       : [x] Consider making it support multiple interfaces to go with
;;;             :     multiple models.
;;; --- History ---
;;; 2002.06.30 Dan
;;;             : Added this header.
;;;             : Renamed this file from uniform-interface-exp to 
;;;             : act-gui-interface.
;;;             : Added comments.
;;; 2002.12.17 Dan
;;;             : Modified correlation and mean-deviation so that
;;;             : the output keyword parameter is "more useful" -
;;;             : specifying a stream works right now (it doesn't try to
;;;             : open a file for it) and specifying nil suppress
;;;             : all output.
;;; 2002.12.19 Dan
;;;             : Updated add-text-to-exp-window so that it now includes
;;;             : a color option.
;;; 04.04.13 Dan [2.2]  (previous two changes also "new" as of 2.2)
;;;             : Changed the copyright notice and added the LGPL stuff.
;;;
;;; 04.10.19 Dan [Moved into ACT-R 6]
;;;             : reset version to 1.0a1
;;;             : added the packaging switches
;;;             : changed permute-list to use act-r-random
;;;
;;; 04.12.17 Dan
;;;             : Added get-time as a replacement for pm-get-time.
;;;   
;;; 2005.02.25 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the ~\newline usages because that causes problems
;;;             :   when a Lisp only wants to see native new lines there.
;;; 2006.09.07 Dan
;;;             : * Changed permute-list so that it's safe when passed nil or
;;;             :   a non-list.
;;; 2007.07.13 Dan
;;;             : * Added color as an option to add-button-to-exp-window.
;;; 2007.12.13 Dan
;;;             : * Adding an add-items-to-exp-window function to compliment
;;;             :   the remove-... and to avoid the need to call the UWI
;;;             :   function when such an action is necessary.
;;; 2009.09.10 Dan
;;;             : * Moved permute-list to the random module's file.
;;; 2010.03.08 Dan
;;;             : * Changed close-exp-window so that it checks to see if the
;;;             :   window is still there before trying to close it.  Avoids
;;;             :   a problem where a user has closed an environment side
;;;             :   window.
;;; 2010.07.31 Dan
;;;             : * Changed add-line-to-exp-window to constrain the x,y positions
;;;             :   to be fixnums to avoid problems in ACL and LispWorks if 
;;;             :   a float or rational is used instead.
;;; 2011.04.26 Dan
;;;             : * Changed get-time to just return mp-time-ms.
;;; 2011.11.14 Dan
;;;             : * Make open-exp-window set the visual center to the center of
;;;             :   the window.
;;; 2011.11.21 Dan
;;;             : * Get-time changed to not use *actr-enabled-p*.  Instead
;;;             :   it uses an optional parameter to determine whether or not 
;;;             :   to use mp-time.
;;;             :   If the optional parameter is provided then a true value
;;;             :   means model time and nil means internal-real-time.  If 
;;;             :   no parameter is provided then model time will be returned.
;;; 2012.06.08 Dan [2.0a1]
;;;             : * Use a module to maintain the information for the open
;;;             :   window(s) and allow multiple open windows for a model.
;;;             :   Multiple models may have the same titled window open and
;;;             :   that should make it "easy" to have multiple models use the
;;;             :   same code to provide separate interfaces.  The real window's
;;;             :   title (which the model can't see anyway) will include the 
;;;             :   model's name to make things easier for the modeler.
;;;             : * The significant changes to the commands are:
;;;             :   - open-exp-window doesn't automatically close a window with
;;;             :     a different title when it creates a new one.   It does
;;;             :     still clear and bring to the front a window by the same
;;;             :     title within the same model.
;;;             :   - Open-exp-window will only create a window if there is a
;;;             :     current model.  The main reason for that is because it 
;;;             :     avoids a lot of hassle of dealing with "unowned"
;;;             :     windows.  It also makes things much easier with respect
;;;             :     to displaying multiple visible virtual windows through
;;;             :     the ACT-R Environment.
;;;             :   - All windows now automatically close when the owning model
;;;             :     is deleted (either explicitly or via clear-all) and if
;;;             :     the new system parameter :close-exp-windows-on-reset is set
;;;             :     it will also close them when the owning model is reset.
;;;             :     [I'd prefer the default for :close-exp-windows-on-reset
;;;             :     to be t, but unfortunately because of how the single
;;;             :     experiment window code worked doing so would likely break 
;;;             :     lots of existing models (since some in the tutorial models
;;;             :     used it in a manner that assumed the window persists).]
;;;             :   - Most of the commands now have an additional keyword 
;;;             :     parameter :window which can be used to indicate which
;;;             :     window to perform the action upon.  If it is not provided
;;;             :     and there is only one window open in the current model
;;;             :     the command will be applied to that window, otherwise it
;;;             :     will result in a warning and no action performed.
;;;             :     The window value can be specified as either the window 
;;;             :     object returned by open-exp-window or the title which
;;;             :     was specified for open-exp-window.  When specifying a title
;;;             :     as the :window parameter that will be relative to the current
;;;             :     model since different models can have windows with the same
;;;             :     title.
;;;             :   - For add-line-to-exp-window the color is now a keyword
;;;             :     parameter instead of optional so that it isn't confusing 
;;;             :     when also specifying a window.  This change is the only one
;;;             :     that's not backward compatible with the previous "single
;;;             :     window" usage and will require changing existing models.
;;; 2012.07.02 Dan
;;;             : * Open-exp-window now calls device-update-attended-loc with a
;;;             :   nil xy-loc when it reuses a window so that the attended marker
;;;             :   gets cleared.
;;; 2012.07.12 Dan
;;;             : * Added the exp-window-owner function because there are times
;;;             :   when it would be useful to know that.
;;; 2012.12.12 Dan
;;;             : * Adding a check to make sure that the text is a string in
;;;             :   add-text-to-exp-window.
;;; 2013.09.30 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Time to remove the a1 from the version.
;;; 2015.05.26 Dan
;;;             : * Added a :font-size parameter to add-text-to-exp-window.
;;; 2016.06.07 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Starting work to add create and modify actions for each of 
;;;             :   default item types.  Create is already supported by the UWI, 
;;;             :   and is being implemented first.
;;;             : * Added a check of the text for a button to make sure it's a
;;;             :   string.
;;; 2016.06.08 Dan
;;;             : * Adding a :class parameter to open-exp-window for passing off
;;;             :   to make-rpm-window to allow for easier extensions while I'm
;;;             :   in here.
;;;             : * Added the front AGI modify functions which call out to UWI
;;;             :   modify functions.
;;; 2016.06.09 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with the use of flatten and push.
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with create-line actually adding it to the 
;;;             :   display as well.
;;; 2016.11.17 Dan
;;;             : * Use current-mp instead of current-meta-process when creating
;;;             :   the table key -- don't need that at all with this version 
;;;             :   since only a single meta-process is supported, but for now
;;;             :   keeping the changes minimal.
;;; 2017.01.04 Dan [4.0]
;;;             : * Only the virtual and visible-virtual windows are used now.
;;;             : * Don't return the window object, but a list of module interface
;;;             :   items for use with the new install-device function.
;;;             : * Make open-exp-window available through the dispatcher with
;;;             :   optional parameters instead of keywords.
;;;             : * Make get-time available through dispatcher.
;;; 2017.01.05 Dan
;;;             : * Added the call to create a device (under the new definition
;;;             :   of what a device is) and assuming now that it's building a
;;;             :   subtype of virtual window underneath.
;;; 2017.01.10 Dan
;;;             : * BIG ISSUE -- right now this code is built around the notion
;;;             :   that the owning model is the only model which could install
;;;             :   the device.  That needs to be corrected, but there isn't a
;;;             :   viable solution for "current-model" in the dispatch environment
;;;             :   yet since one can't just wrap a macro around a set of rpc calls...
;;;             :   The init and remove device functions would probably need to
;;;             :   have the model passed in I think, as well as other things.
;;; 2017.01.12 Dan
;;;             : * Added a remote version of clear-exp-window.
;;;             : * Removed the clear on reset parameter -- they will always be
;;;             :   closed upon reset.
;;; 2017.01.18 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the echo-act-r-output from commands.  The assumption
;;;             :   now is that echoing is handled by the user.
;;;             : * Use handle-evaluate-results.
;;; 2017.01.20 Dan
;;;             : * Automatically install a keyboard device for motor if there
;;;             :   isn't one when a window is opened.
;;; 2017.01.26 Dan
;;;             : * Fix the call that adds the correlation function since it was
;;;             :   cut and pasted from mean-deviation and still said that.
;;; 2017.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Change the 'local' versions of the commands so that they have
;;;             :   the same signature as the remote ones.
;;; 2017.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Add-act-r-command call parameters reordered.
;;; 2017.02.08 Dan
;;;             : * Reworked the local versions of the remote commands to not
;;;             :   go out through the dispatcher.
;;;             : * Fixed some bugs with the last update.
;;; 2017.02.09 Dan
;;;             : * Add remote versions of create and add for lines.
;;;             : * Convert strings for colors to symbols in text and line functions.
;;; 2017.02.24 Dan
;;;             : * Test the parameters given to open-exp-window because this
;;;             :   (open-exp-window "" :visible t) construct from before causes
;;;             :   problems now.
;;; 2017.03.02 Dan
;;;             : * Moved the installation of a keyboard and mouse from the
;;;             :   opening of the window to the installing.
;;;             : * Updated and added the button create and add commands.
;;; 2017.03.03 Dan
;;;             : * Creating a button checks the action function for a valid
;;;             :   value at creation time now.
;;;             : * When an experiment window is installed it also installs
;;;             :   a mouse for itself (removing a previously installed mouse),
;;;             :   and it now provides a signal-interface so that the mouse
;;;             :   can send move and click notices directly instead of having
;;;             :   to catch them with a monitor.
;;; 2017.03.08 Dan
;;;             : * Removing an exp-window needs to remove all the visual
;;;             :   features it has added because can't rely on vision doing so
;;;             :   since it doesn't know who 'owns' them and can't just kill
;;;             :   all of them when the device is removed.
;;; 2017.03.09 Dan
;;;             : * Updated the modify-line-for-exp-window command and made it
;;;             :   available externally.
;;; 2017.03.10 Dan
;;;             : * Convert a string color in modify-line-for-exp-window to a
;;;             :   symbol if possible, and check if the line is actually in the
;;;             :   window before asking vision to modify the visicon features.
;;; 2017.03.16 Dan
;;;             : * Comment out most of modify-text-for-exp-window because it
;;;             :   doesn't work yet and want to avoid the compiler warnings.
;;; 2017.05.31 Dan [5.0]
;;;             : * As a first step to dealing with the model issue this is now
;;;             :   being implemented as a component instead of a module -- that
;;;             :   removes the need for a current model and should provide a
;;;             :   path for multiple models to use the same device.  
;;; 2017.06.08 Dan 
;;;             : * Fixed modify-line-for-exp-window so that it works right with
;;;             :   respect to updating all the models that have the window installed.
;;; 2017.06.13 Dan
;;;             : * The agi module itself needs a lock to protect access to its
;;;             :   internal components.
;;; 2017.06.14 Dan
;;;             : * The remove-exp-window function needs to return true for the
;;;             :   remove-device command to work.
;;;             : * Reorganized some locking in open and close because open can
;;;             :   call close and close may call remove-exp-window which all
;;;             :   need the agi lock, but remove-exp-window will be in a 
;;;             :   different thread since it is called through the dispatcher.
;;; 2017.06.16 Dan
;;;             : * Make the agi-lock directly instead of using an act-r-lock.
;;; 2017.06.23 Dan
;;;             : * Added a name for the lock.
;;; 2017.06.30 Dan
;;;             : * Got rid of the data structure since it's not used anywhere.
;;; 2017.07.13 Dan
;;;             : * Add some error detection to the file opening in mean-deviation
;;;             :   and correlation and pass output to act-r-output if there
;;;             :   isn't a current model.
;;; 2017.08.16 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with modify-line-for-exp-window because 
;;;             :   determine-exp-window doesn't really do what it's named if
;;;             :   a sub-view is passed to it.
;;; 2017.08.17 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with close-exp-window because it held the
;;;             :   agi lock while remove-device was called but that can dispatch
;;;             :   things that might need that lock through the remove function
;;;             :   of the device.
;;; 2017.09.13 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed close-all-exp-windows to use the the window list 
;;;             :   instead of the global table since that contains more than
;;;             :   windows.
;;; 2017.11.01 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the extra new-line in the correlation and mean-deviation
;;;             :   output when using command-output or act-r-output.
;;; 2017.11.16 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with valid-button-action because it looped forever
;;;             :   with nil.
;;; 2018.02.08 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with remove-items-from-exp-window and clear-exp-
;;;             :   window because they didn't remove the underlying visual features
;;;             :   from the dialog item.  They just removed the chunk name for 
;;;             :   the feature.
;;;             : * Remove-exp-window doesn't need to inform the vision module
;;;             :   about features being removed if the window isn't actually
;;;             :   installed (which can happen because of a reset while it was
;;;             :   installed -- the reset still needs to clear the features from
;;;             :   the underlying window structures but not the visicon).
;;; 2018.03.05 Dan
;;;             : * Install a microphone for the speech module if there isn't
;;;             :   already one installed.
;;; 2018.03.13 Dan
;;;             : * All coordinates must be global now because multiple windows
;;;             :   are allowed and a single mouse is used for all of them which
;;;             :   has global coordinates.
;;;             : * Because a model can have multiple windows the installed-windows
;;;             :   needs to be a table instead of just an alist.
;;; 2018.03.14 Dan
;;;             : * Opening the window installs the monitors for the signals that
;;;             :   matter (click-mouse, move-cursor, delete-cursor, and update-
