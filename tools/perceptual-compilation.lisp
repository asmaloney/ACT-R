;;;
;;; 2010.12.06 Dan
;;;             : * Created automatically by build-compilation-type-file.
;;;             : * Added the details of the functions.
;;; 2012.04.04 Dan [1.1]
;;;             : * Added the whynot reason function.
;;; 2014.05.07 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Start of conversion to typeless chunks.
;;; 2019.04.26 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Allow compilation of perceptual buffers when strict harvesting
;;;             :   is turned off over cases which would be stuffed buffers when
;;;             :   it is on.
;;; 2020.06.22 Dan [4.0]
;;;             : * The functions are now all passed the same set of parameters:
;;;             :   buffer module p1 p1-s p1-index p2 p2-s p2-index
;;;             :   the p1-s and p2-s are the new "standard" representation that
;;;             :   can be decomposed with composition-rep-* where * is:
;;;             :    op -- the character of the operation =,?,!,+,-,*,@
;;;             :    name -- the symbol naming the buffer or bang action
;;;             :    token -- the symbol of the production item for op and name
;;;             :    slots -- list of slot-spec lists
;;; 2020.11.05 Dan [4.1]
;;;             : * Drop buffer empty queries that occur in p2 if the buffer
;;;             :   was strict harvested from p1 otherwise you end up with a
;;;             :   production that can't fire since it tests for both there
;;;             :   being a chunk in the buffer and a query that it's empty.
;;; 2020.11.10 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the typo of modfication in the failure strings.
