;;; Filename    : buffer-trace.lisp
;;; Version     : 3.1
;;; 
;;; Description : Provide a tool that shows what activities are occuring in
;;;             : the buffers instead of the current "event" based trace and
;;;             : make that information available to the modeler as well if
;;;             : desired.
;;; 
;;; Bugs        : 
;;;
;;; To do       : [] Watch the :trace-filter parameter and warn if it gets set
;;;             :    to a function other than disable-event-trace when the buffer
;;;             :    trace is enabled.
;;;             : [] Better monitor the setting/removing of the pre-event hook.
;;; 
;;; ----- History -----
;;; 2006.01.26 Dan
;;;             : * Initial creation.
;;; 2006.02.07 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with subseq going past the end of the event-details.
;;; 2006.07.18 Dan
;;;             : * Changed schedule-maintenance-event-relative to just
;;;             :   schedule-event-relative because maintenance is now just a 
;;;             :   keyword in all of the scheduling functions.
;;; 2006.09.11 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the parameter test for the trace step to just be posnumornil.
;;; 2007.05.18 Dan
;;;             : * Added the busy->free flag to the buffer summary records because
;;;             :   it's possible for a module to be marked as busy during some 
;;;             :   early events and then become free later at the same time
;;;             :   and that can be useful to know.
;;; 2007.05.22 Dan
;;;             : * Added two parameters for use with the graphic trace tools
;;;             :   in the environment: :buffer-trace-colors and :graphic-column-widths.
;;;             : * Took the a1 off the version number.
;;;             : * Added the additional slot of notes to the buffer summary 
;;;             :   records and added the command add-buffer-trace-notes
;;;             :   to allow one to add them to the record.  
;;; 2007.06.06 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the value returned when setting the :traced-buffers
;;;             :   parameter.
;;;             : * Added the error->clear flag to the buffer summary records
;;;             :   because like busy->free that can be an important transition.
;;; 2011.04.25 Dan
;;;             : * Converting to using the ms time internally.  The buffer-
;;;             :   record-time-stamp slot will no longer be a member of the 
;;;             :   structure, but a function with the same name will still
;;;             :   return the time in seconds.  The slot will be buffer-record-
;;;             :   ms-time and hold an integer count of milliseconds instead.
;;; 2011.06.17 Dan
;;;             : * Added an update function and use that to call the trace-hook
;;;             :   functions instead of doing it in the post hook because that
;;;             :   is problematic since the first event of the new time has already
;;;             :   occurred before the hooks get called.
;;; 2011.11.11 Dan 
;;;             : * Added an optional parameter to get-current-buffer-trace to allow
;;;             :   the user to clear the history if desired for performance
;;;             :   purposes.  
;;;             : * Changed add-buffer-trace-notes to return the notes passed
;;;             :   instead of the event that gets scheduled and check to make
;;;             :   sure the buffer is a valid name.
;;; 2013.09.18 Dan
;;;             : * Fixing it so that setting the buffer-trace param returns the
;;;             :   value that was set.
;;; 2014.03.17 Dan [2.0]
;;;            : * Changed the query-buffer call to be consistent with the new
;;;            :   internal code.
;;; 2014.05.28 Dan
;;;            : * Changed how the module request summary is recorded since it
;;;            :   can't be the chunk-type of the spec.  Now it's the whole 
;;;            :   spec printed to a single line.
;;; 2014.10.22 Dan
;;;            : * When the buffer-trace-step is set only record steps when there's
;;;            :   a "real" action that's going to occur i.e. if the run would
;;;            :   end without the step event let it.
;;; 2015.03.18 Dan
;;;            : * Fixed the return value from setting :save-buffer-trace so it
;;;            :   returns t when set to t.
;;;            : * Changed the parameter warning strings to remove the final '.'.
;;; 2015.06.04 Dan
;;;            : * The :buffer-trace-step parameter was returning an incorrectly
;;;            :   converted result since it's set in seconds.
;;; 2015.06.05 Dan
;;;            : * Use schedule-event-now instead of a realtive 0.
;;; 2016.04.20 Dan
;;;            : * Fixed a bug that prevented one from setting :traced-buffers
;;;            :   to nil.
;;; 2016.06.18 Dan
;;;            : * Fixed a bug with the return value of :buffer-trace-hook when it
;;;            :   gets set.
;;; 2016.06.21 Dan
;;;            : * Fixed a bug with the previous fix.
;;; 2017.08.09 Dan
;;;            : * Replaced capture-model-output with a call to printed-chunk-spec.
;;; 2017.09.28 Dan [3.0]
;;;            : * Transition to the history data stream mechanism and eliminating
;;;            :   the buffer trace option (for now at least).  Also removing all
;;;            :   of the parameters for the module:
;;;            :      - GUI based parameters (size and color) because those
;;;            :        should be options in the GUI
;;;            :      - buffer-trace and -step since the trace is going away
;;;            :      - save- and traced- because those now go through the 
;;;            :        general history recording tool
;;;            :      - trace-hook because nothing else needs it and I doubt anyone
;;;            :        actually uses it
;;;            : * The default is for all buffers to be off now instead of on.
;;;            : * Added a lock to protect access.
;;;            : * Catch erase-buffer and treat like clear-buffer.
;;; 2017.10.02 Dan
;;;            : * Instead of just the + or * at the start of the request details
;;;            :   for default actions include the buffer and > too e.g. +goal>.
;;; 2017.10.03 Dan
;;;            : * Moved the translator/accessor functions for the data lists 
;;;            :   to here from the environment trace processing code.
;;; 2018.02.05 Dan
;;;            : * Updated this to use the internal event slot accessors and get
;;;            :   the real struct since it's going to be passed the id.
;;; 2018.02.22 Dan
;;;            : * Protect access to the event time and priority.
;;; 2018.02.28 Dan
;;;            : * Fixed a bug in with the last update.
;;; 2018.03.02 Dan
;;;            : * Updated define-history-component to -constituent.
;;; 2018.03.16 Dan
;;;            : * Meta-p-schedule-lock is recursive.
;;; 2018.03.20 Dan
;;;            : * Add a remote version of add-buffer-trace-notes and convert the
;;;            :   buffer name provided from a string if needed.
;;; 2018.06.22 Dan
;;;            : * Only the remote add-buffer-trace-notes allows a string name.
;;; 2018.07.31 Dan
;;;            : * Add optional parameters to the buffer-trace history stream
;;;            :   to allow specifying start and stop times.
;;; 2020.01.14 Dan [3.1]
;;;            : * Buffer-trace history constituents can't be lambdas.

;;;
;;; General Docs:
;;; 
;;; The following information is recorded at each event of the model and aggregated
;;; over all events at a given time:
;;; 
;;; Whether the module is busy
;;; Whether the module transitioned from busy to free at this time
;;; Whether the module is in an error
;;; Whether the buffer is full
;;; Whether the buffer is cleared
;;; Whether the chunk in the buffer is modified
;;;
;;; Whether a request is sent to the module
;;; Whether a new chunk is set in the buffer
;;; Any notes which are recorded using add-buffer-trace-notes.
;;;
;;; For the first 6, if the stated condition is true during any event at the
;;; current time the buffer record will indicate t.
;;;
;;; For the requests, each request overwrites any prior request recorded
;;; at that time.  The value recorded is the details string provided for the event
;;; if there was one or a printing of the request's chunk-spec if not.
;;; If a chunk is set into the buffer, then the name of that chunk is recorded,
;;; and only the last setting at a specific time is recorded.
;;; The notes are set to the string specified by add-buffer-trace-notes, but
;;; only the last note at a given time will be saved (they overwrite).

;;;  (defstruct buffer-record ms-time buffers)
;;;  (defstruct buffer-summary name cleared busy busy->free error full modified request chunk-name notes)
;;;
;;;
;;; add-buffer-trace-notes
;;;
;;;    Takes two parameters which are the name of a buffer and any notes
;;;    to set for the buffer summary of that buffer at the current time.  
;;;
;;;    This can be used to augment the summaries on the fly, and would most likely
;;;    be called from an event hook that was watching for something that needed to
;;;    be noted.
;;;
;;;    There are no restrictions on what can be passed as notes.
;;;    
;;;    Calling this will create a maintenance event which records the notes at
;;;    the current time.
;;;
;;;    The graphic trace tools will display the notes when the mouse is placed over
;;;    the corresponding box in the trace (the notes will be printed using the Lisp
;;;    format string "~a").
;;;    
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;
;;; Design Choices:
;;; 
;;; Grown out of Scott's graphic module tracer and the old environment's PERT
;;; style trace.  The idea being that instead of looking at the specific actions
;;; of a module one can "watch" the buffers since they're the interface to
;;; the module.  As long as a module takes requests through the buffers and 
;;; responds to the state queries appropriately it can be monitored.
;;;
;;; The addition of the production buffer was necessary so that the procedural
;;; module could be queried and report "requests" (production firings) like
;;; any other module.  It is a bit strange, and not really a buffer of the
;;; theory (note it doesn't end in 'al') but may end up being so as work on
;;; meta-cognitive processing continues - being able to monitor the state 
;;; of the prodceural system may be an important thing to do.
