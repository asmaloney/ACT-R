;;; ----- History -----
;;;
;;; 2010.12.10 Dan
;;;             : * Created automatically by build-compilation-type-file.
;;; 2010.12.13 Dan
;;;             : * Put the control functions and tests in place.
;;; 2010.12.15 Dan
;;;             : * Added module to the mapping functions args list.
;;; 2010.12.20 Dan
;;;             : * Added some additional code to handle things better when 
;;;             :   :ppm is enabled -- creates productions that match more closely
;;;             :   to the same conditions as the original pair did and does 
;;;             :   the "same" thing.
;;;             : * Allow subtypes to be composed in the consistency check.
;;; 2011.01.07 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with map-imaginal-buffer since it needs to be a
;;;             :   let* for ppm to be used.
;;; 2011.04.28 Dan
;;;             : * Added some declares to avoid compiler warnings.
;;; 2012.04.04 Dan [1.1]
;;;             : * Added the whynot reason function.
;;; 2014.05.07 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Start of conversion to typeless chunks.
;;;             : * Pass the module to constant-value-p.
;;;             : * References to compilation-module-previous are now using a
;;;             :   structure instead of list.
;;; 2016.08.04 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Updated the compilation type definition with one that was
;;;             :   created automatically by build-compilation-type-file from the
;;;             :   new spreadsheet that better handles "safe" compilation based
;;;             :   on whether the buffer is strict harvested or not.  Also added
;;;             :   some cases which should have been allowed but weren't like 13,40
;;;             :   where the * in the second can be combined with the + from the
;;;             :   first and 40,9 which can combine an = with a preceeding * (there
;;;             :   are some other similar additions but not listing all of them here).
;;;             :   Those new cases make things more consistent with respect to the
;;;             :   indicated constraints.
;;;             : * Added the code necessary to deal with the new cases and the 
;;;             :   new test functions.
;;; 2020.06.22 Dan [4.0]
;;;             : * The functions are now all passed the same set of parameters:
;;;             :   buffer module p1 p1-s p1-index p2 p2-s p2-index
;;;             :   the p1-s and p2-s are the new "standard" representation that
;;;             :   can be decomposed with composition-rep-* where * is:
;;;             :    op -- the character of the operation =,?,!,+,-,*,@
;;;             :    name -- the symbol naming the buffer or bang action
;;;             :    token -- the symbol of the production item for op and name
;;;             :    slots -- list of slot-spec lists
;;; 2020.11.05 Dan [4.1]
;;;             : * Drop buffer empty queries that occur in p2 if the buffer
;;;             :   was strict harvested from p1 otherwise you end up with a
;;;             :   production that can't fire since it tests for both there
;;;             :   being a chunk in the buffer and a query that it's empty.
