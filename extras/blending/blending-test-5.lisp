;; This example is similar to the others, except that 
;; it sets the :blend-all-slots parameter to t and
;; makes a couple of other changes to show that in
;; action: 
;;  - the keys are created using a specific type and added 
;;    to DM (the specific type is used because otherwise
;;    all chunks of type chunk would be considered valid
;;    values)
;;  - the value slot is used in the second request instead 
;;    of the key.
