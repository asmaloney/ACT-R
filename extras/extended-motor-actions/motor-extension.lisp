;;; Description : Collection of extensions for the motor module which include:
;;;             : separate processor and/or execution stages for each hand, buffers
;;;             : to track the separate hand usage, actions for holding keys,
;;;             : and "press-key like" actions for holding keys and for hitting
;;;             : a key without recoiling to the home row.
;;; 
;;; Bugs        : 
;;;
;;; To do       : [ ] Should a point-finger action send a notification?
;;;             :     Currently the normal point-hand actions don't so not
;;;             :     doing that here either, but if that changes need to make
;;;             :     the change here as well.

;;; ----- History -----
;;; 2014.04.24 Dan [1.0a1]
;;;             : * Initial creation.  Combining the separate extensions that
;;;             :   were used for modeling Space Fortress, cleaning them up so
;;;             :   that the "regular" motor actions work correctly with them,
;;;             :   and adding the new "typing" actions.
;;; 2014.05.16 Dan [1.1a1]
;;;             : * This version is for ACT-R 6.1.
;;;             : * Fixed all the calls to check-specs to pass the name.
;;;             : * Commented out the handle-extended-style method and use
;;;             :   handle-style-request for the actions instead.
;;;             : * Changed the verify-single-explicit-value calls because of
;;;             :   the different way it works now.
;;; 2014.06.16 Dan [2.0a1]
;;;             : * Fix prepare-movement for typeless chunk mechanism so that
;;;             :   setting of the hands' last command values still works.
;;; 2015.06.05 Dan
;;;             : * Change all the scheduling to ms.
;;; 2015.08.06 Dan [2.0a2]
;;;             : * Adding a release-all-fingers action which is special in that
;;;             :   it doesn't jam the module because it will reschedule itself
;;;             :   if the preparation is busy repeatedly until it becomes free
;;;             :   and then after the init cost it will call the release action
;;;             :   for each finger which is down.
;;; 2015.08.07 Dan
;;;             : * Cleaning up the distinction between up/down and busy/free
;;;             :   for a finger -- those were conflated before because it
;;;             :   said set-finger-up but what it really meant was set finger
;;;             :   free.  There wasn't a real indication of being down and one
;;;             :   could mistake a busy finger for down.
;;;             :   Since busy/free is measured at the "hand" level the fingers
;;;             :   don't need to really indicate busy/free, just up or down,
;;;             :   but it may be necessary to detect intermediate states at the
;;;             :   finger level i.e. that a finger is making an action even 
;;;             :   though the key isn't up or down yet.  So actually tracking
;;;             :   both separately for the fingers.  A query for a finger of
;;;             :   busy means that it's between the initiation and finish 
;;;             :   stages of an action (like the hand would indicate) whereas
;;;             :   a query of up or down indicates where the finger is with
;;;             :   respect to the key it's over.
;;;             : * Actually implementing device-handle-keyrelease and device-
;;;             :   handle-click-release methods instead of only calling the
;;;             :   event handler functions directly so that a new device can
;;;             :   receive that info appropriately.
;;;             : * The replacement motor module now has a slot for the extension
;;;             :   module.
;;;             : * Instead of a style directly scheduling the output-key and 
;;;             :   release-key methods it needs to call the key-up and key-down 
;;;             :   methods which will then call output-key and release-key.
;;; 2015.08.10 Dan
;;;             : * Fixing bugs with the previous updates.
;;; 2015.08.13 Dan
;;;             : * The device-handle-click-release method only has one parameter
;;;             :   now, the device, like device-handle-click.
;;;             : * The finger up/down queries are now available.
;;;             : * Changed rand-time calls to randomize-time.
;;; 2015.08.19 Dan
;;;             : * Only generate the press or release if the finger isn't in
;;;             :   that state i.e. can't have two presses without a release
;;;             :   between them.
;;; 2015.09.23 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Make the necessary updates to be compatible with the new
;;;             :   request completion changes to the movement styles and
;;;             :   change the new action functions to work with those updates.
;;; 2015.09.25 Dan
;;;             : * Release-all-fingers wasn't recording the request for completion.
;;; 2018.02.19 Dan [3.1]
;;;             : * Delay checking that the finger is down for the release actions
;;;             :   until execution time because it could prepare it while the
;;;             :   finger was still executing the down stroke.
;;; 2018.10.09 Dan [4.0]
;;;             : * Updating this for 7.x.  Lots of changes necessary.
;;;             : * Adding the delayed-punch extension in as well.
;;; 2018.10.11 Dan [4.1]
;;;             : * Added another parameter: :cursor-drag-delay which slows down
;;;             :   cursor movement when a finger on the same hand is also held
;;;             :   down.  Defaults to nil (off), can be set to t (.8) or a #
;;;             :   which is added to the control order for the Fitts coefficient
;;;             :   calculation.  The .8 value seems to be a reasonable value
;;;             :   for fitting data from the paper below with other defaults:

;;;             :   Computing Systems (CHI '91), Scott P. Robertson, Gary M. Olson,

;;;             :   DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/108844.108868 
;;; 2018.10.12 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the status functions since they need to return a string
;;;             :   now.
;;;             : * Fixed the cursor-ply class because it needs a cursor slot.
;;;             : * Changed all the 'old' style methods to be on motor-mod class
;;;             :   instead of the new class to avoid oddities in finding the
;;;             :   right method.
;;;             : * It's much worse than that... Basically, I can't fall back to
;;;             :   a general dual queue-output-events because the 'old' specific
;;;             :   queue-output-events get in the way.  So I have to define 
;;;             :   every method which was defined for the old version here too
;;;             :   (or go through some ugly remove-method hoops to get rid of
;;;             :   what I don't want, or start from scratch and ignore the
;;;             :   movement-style class at the top, or probably some other 
;;;             :   ugly thing I haven't considered).
;;; 2018.10.15 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with the mouse drag timing (it was checking
;;;             :   for busy instead of down).
;;; 2018.10.16 Dan
;;;             : * All-home needs to just move the fingers because if it uses
;;;             :   point-finger it will jam if there're multiple fingers to
;;;             :   move, and it has to do it at the finish time so that any
;;;             :   fingers which are down are released first.
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in queue-output events for a peck-recoil.
;;;             : * The style name for all peck and peck-recoil type actions is
;;;             :   just peck (as is true for the normal actions).
;;;             : * Renamed key-up and key-down set-finger-up and set-finger-down.
;;; 2018.10.17 Dan
;;;             : * Adjust how I handle the :peck-strike-distance calculation
;;;             :   to not assume linear motion and fix a bug in the calculation.
;;;             :   Now it uses the minimum jerk trajectory profile to find the
;;;             :   appropriate time to get to the striking distance, and it's
;;;             :   using a simple search using minjerk-dist to find that time
;;;             :   since it's a 5th order polynomial so there's no closed form
;;;             :   solution for time and a "fancy" solution is going to be at
;;;             :   least as costly as a few calls (typically all that's needed
;;;             :   to get close enough: +/- .01 key width).
;;; 2019.08.08 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a typo in a parameter doc string.
;;; 2020.01.10 Dan [4.2]
;;;             : * Removed the #' and lambdas from param valid functions since 
;;;             :   that's not allowed in the general system now.
;;; 2020.04.06 Dan [5.0]
;;;             : * Updated with the changes necessary to track the separation 
;;;             :   of current position and next starting position as well as
;;;             :   add the request time to the standard events as the normal
;;;             :   motor module does now.
;;;             : * Changed point-finger to use an exec-time that matches when
;;;             :   the finger is "at" the key (init + fitts time).  That means
;;;             :   there's an extra chance for a conflict-resolution at that
;;;             :   time relative to before, which seems reasonable -- when the
;;;             :   finger gets there maybe something else could happen.
;;;             : * Changed all-fingers-to-home to both mark all the fingers as
;;;             :   busy during the action and to have a time that's the max of
;;;             :   200ms and the times for each hand to do a hand-ply back to
;;;             :   home position.
;;;             : * The release on a punch doesn't include the extra burst cost
;;;             :   now to be consistent with the timing of peck and peck-recoil
;;;             :   actions (a 90ms down time was too long).
;;;             : * The timing of the release-all-fingers event now matches 
;;;             :   when the release happens instead of a burst time later.
;;;             : * Go back to a single exec queue which now is searched for
;;;             :   an available action, possibly for each hand, since the two
;;;             :   queue approach had issues with skipping over a both when
;;;             :   one of the hands was free.
;;; 2020.04.20 Dan
;;;             : * Updated to work with the new location information in the
;;;             :   keyboard.
;;; 2020.05.21 Dan [5.1]
;;;             : * Added a new parameter, :relay-hand-requests which if set to
;;;             :   t will pass requests to manual-left and manual-right on to
;;;             :   the manual buffer.  The requests must still include a hand
;;;             :   feature when required because they can't just add one in
;;;             :   since it isn't possible to know when that is required in
;;;             :   advance.  If a hand feature is included in the request, it
;;;             :   must match the buffer to be relayed.  Enabling this switch
;;;             :   will affect the buffer trace information because the request
;;;             :   for an action will only be recorded for the specific buffer
;;;             :   which makes the request and not the buffer which corresponds
;;;             :   to the hand that is used (for example a press-key request
;;;             :   which only generates the hand after preparing the features
;;;             :   could be attributed to the wrong buffer).
;;; 2020.06.24 Dan [6.0]
;;;             : * Updated the create-motor-module function because now it must
;;;             :   also specify the types.
;;; 2020.10.12 Dan [6.1]
;;;             : * Adjust the actions that are scheduling the prepare-movement
;;;             :   so it displays in the low detail trace.  Prior to the fix
;;;             :   for preparation free they were all just calling it and had
;;;             :   the event shown automatically in the low detail trace.

;;;
;;; General Docs:
;;; 
;;; Combining a lot of updates to the motor module together in one place which
;;; should be useable as a replacement for the default module without breaking
;;; any existing models which use motor actions.  
;;; 
;;; The big changes with the update:
;;;
;;; The model can now generate actions for pressing and releasing keys which can
;;; be detected by the modeler.  The actions from the existing module (punch,
;;; peck, peck-recall, and press-key) all now result in both a press and release
;;; of the key/button.  
;;;
;;; With the addition of keys being able to be held down the previous motor module
;;; actions (the styles punch, peck, peck-recoil, and point-hand and all the 
;;; higher-level actions which use them press-key, click-mouse, hand-to-home,
;;; hand-to-mouse, and point-hand-at-key) have been modified so that if the finger(s)
;;; used to perform the action is currently holding a key down there's an extra 
;;; burst-time cost to execute the release of that key before performing the
;;; specified action. 
;;;
;;; The trace of the motor actions for preparing, initiating, and finishing an
;;; action now indicate which action and hand it corresponds to since there may
;;; be parallel actions on going. (The old module also could have some overlapping
;;; actions which occasionally lead to confusion in the trace, but it didn't 
;;; happen very often).
;;;
;;; The new motor module now has the option of using separate execution and/or 
;;; processor stages for the two hands which allows motor actions on different 
;;; hands to potentially operate in parallel.  There is still only one preparation
;;; stage however.  The default operation of the new module is for one execution
;;; stages and one processor stage, like the standard motor module, but that can
;;; be changed with parameters described below.
;;;
;;; There are two new sets of motor actions which can be used.  The first set
;;; provides separate low-level actions for holding and releasing keys.  The other 
;;; set is more high-level actions like press-key which perform touch typing 
;;; operations with holding keys and without always recoiling to the home row.
;;; Details on the new actions are found below.
;;;
;;; There is a new module created, named motor-extension, which adds two new
;;; buffers, manual-left and manual-right.  These can be used for tracking the 
;;; operation of the model's hands separately and also allows for querying 
;;; whether individual fingers are currently busy i.e. holding down a key.
;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;
;;; Public API:
;;;
;;; release-key (model key)
;;;
;;; the signal that can be monitored to detect the release of a key just like
;;; output-key notes the pressing.  Generated by the new default keyboard device
;;; included with this extension.
;;;
;;; release-mouse (model position finger)
;;; 
;;; The signal that can be monitored to detect the release of a button on
;;; the mouse like click-mouse notes the press.  Generated by the new default
;;; mouse cursor device included with this extension.
;;; 
;;; 
;;; New model parameters:
;;;
;;; :key-closure-time (default value .01)
;;; 
;;; The time in seconds between when a key is contacted (the corresponding movement 
;;; action has started pressing it) and when it registers as being hit.  By default
;;; only used for the timing of punch actions, but see the :peck-strike-distance
;;; parameter below for how it may affect peck/peck-recoil actions as well.  Note,
;;; this value has always existed within the device interface, but was not previously
;;; made directly available to the modeler.
;;;
;;; :key-release-time (default value .04)
;;;
;;; The time in seconds between when the action which is releasing a key is started
;;; and when that key actually registers as being released.  Used in the timing of
;;; all the actions which include a releasing of a key.  The assumption is that there
;;; is some distance over which the finger must be moved before the key stops being
;;; pressed.  All of the release actions are based on a burst-time cost, thus this
;;; parameter should be set to a value no greater than the value of the :MOTOR-BURST-TIME
;;; parameter.  
;;;
;;; NOTE: Those two parameters should really be modeled as a distance instead of a time
;;; cost, but since the motor movement code isn't modeled at that fine grain of detail
;;; (exact finger positions in 3-space) a simple cost assumption is used.
;;;
;;; :dual-processor-stages (default value nil)
;;;
;;; A boolean indicating whether the motor module should use separate processor
;;; stages for each hand.
;;;
;;; :dual-execution-stages (default value nil)
;;;
;;; A boolean indicating whether the motor module should use separate execution
;;; stages for each hand.
;;;
;;; :peck-strike-distance (default 0.0)
;;; 
;;; The distance from the center of a key at which a peck action is considered
;;; to make contact with the key and start depressing it.  The value can be
;;; from 0 to .5 (the width of a key is 1.0 and movement is computed from 
;;; center of key to center of key thus the finger movement crosses at least
;;; half of the target key when striking it).  This affects when the output-key
;;; action occurs.  The default motor module assumes that the action occurs 
;;; after the entire movement completes and ignores the key closure time which
;;; is what will still happen if the value is set to nil.  
;;; 
;;; If it is set to a non-nil value then the peck and peck-recoil actions
;;; will generate the output-key action at the time: ct + t(d - psd) where
;;; ct is the key-closure-time, t(x) is the time along a minimum jerk velocity
;;; profile for the whole movement at which the distance is x, d is the
;;; length of the whole movement and psd is the value of :peck-strike-distance.
;;; 
;;; :default-punch-delay (.075s default)
;;; 
;;; This is the delay time for a delayed-punch action when the model doesn't 
;;; specify a delay.
;;; 
;;; :fast-punch-delay (.05s default)
;;; 
;;; This is the delay time for a delayed-punch action when the model specifies
;;; a delay of fast.
;;; 
;;; :slow-punch-delay (.1s default)
;;; 
;;; This is the delay time for a delayed-punch action when the model specifies
;;; a delay of slow.
;;;
;;;
;;; :cursor-drag-delay (nil default)
;;; 
;;; Indicates whether to slow down cursor drag actions, and if so by how much.
;;; If set to t or a number then that number is added to the control order
;;; value of the cursor before calculating the time with Fitts' Law.  A value
;;; of t sets it to .8 which provides a reasonable match to data from this paper:

;;;
;;; New Buffers for tracking hands: 
;;; 
;;; manual-left and manual-right
;;; 
;;; Each buffer allows for the same queries as the manual buffer except for
;;; the preparation query which it does not track.  The processor and execution
;;; queries of these buffers are busy if the corresponding hand is performing an
;;; action (or if either hand is when there aren't separate stages).  The state
;;; is busy if there is an action being prepared or if the processor or execution
;;; for this hand is busy.
;;; Each also adds additional queries for the fingers on that hand.  A finger
;;; query of busy is true if the finger is currently involved in an action which
;;; is occurring (actions which affect the whole hand do not involve the individual
;;; fingers) otherwise busy is false and free is true.
;;; A query of the finger for up will be true if the finger is not currently holding
;;; down a key and false if it is not.
;;; A query of the finger for down will be true if the finger is currently holding
;;; down a key and false if it is not.
;;; Down and up are mutually exclusive, eventhough there is potentially a non-zero
;;; time period during which the key and finger is transitioning from up to down or
;;; vice-versa the state changes at the same time as the corresponding output method
;;; gets called i.e. at the "real" make/break point of the press.
;;;
;;; Here is the output of the buffer-status call for the manual-left buffer for
;;; reference:
;;;
;;; MANUAL-LEFT:

;;; 
;;; Press and hold down the indicated finger.  If the finger

;;;
;;; cmd release
;;;  hand [left | right]
;;;  finger [index | middle | ring | pinkie | thumb]
;;;
;;; Stop holding down the indicated finger and leave it where it

;;;  r distance
;;;  theta direction
;;;
;;; Stop holding down the indicated finger and then move it based on the
;;; distance and direction given without performing a press when it 
;;; completes the movement.  If the finger is not being held down do nothing and
;;; output a warning.

;;; cmd delayed-punch
;;;  hand [ left | right ]
;;;  finger [ index | middle | ring | pinkie | thumb ]
;;;  {delay [ fast | slow | # ] }
;;; 
;;; Press down and then release the indicated finger in its current
;;; location.  The release will occur delay seconds after the press
;;; if delay is provided as a number.  If delay is not provided then 
;;; the default delay time is used.  If delay is either fast or slow, 
;;; then the value is taken from the corresponding parameter.  If
;;; :randomize-time is enabled then the delay will be randomized
;;; regardless of how it was indicated.  If the finger is currently being
;;; held release it before performing this movement.

;;;
;;;
;;; isa type-key
;;;  key key
;;;
;;; Move the appropriate finger to the key and press and release it.  The
;;; finger is moved from where it currently is (unlike press-key which assumes
;;; it's on the home position) and returns to where it was after striking the key
;;; (which may not be the home row position). If the finger is currently being 
;;; held release it before performing this movement.

;;;
;;;
;;; isa hit-key
;;;  key key
;;;
;;; Move the appropriate finger to the key and press and release it.  The
;;; finger is moved from where it currently is (unlike press-key which assumes
;;; it's on the home position) and stays over the key which is hit.  If the finger
;;; is currently being held release it before performing this movement.

;;;
;;;
;;; isa hold-key
;;;  key key
;;;
;;; Move the appropriate finger to the key and press it keeping it held down.  The
;;; finger is moved from where it currently is (unlike press-key which assumes
;;; it's on the home position).  If the finger is currently being held release it
;;; before performing this movement.

;;;
;;;
;;; isa release-key
;;;  key key
;;;
;;; If the appropriate finger for that key is currently holding it down release it
;;; and leave the finger at that position.  If the finger is not holding down that
;;; key print a warning and do nothing.
;;;
;;;
;;; isa release-key-to-home
;;;  key key
;;;
;;; If the appropriate finger for that key is currently holding it down release it
;;; and move the finger back to its home position without striking the corresponding
;;; home key.  If the finger is not holding down that key print a warning and do nothing.
;;;
;;;
;;; isa move-to-key
;;;  key key
;;;
;;; Move the appropriate finger to that key without pressing it.  The finger is moved
;;; from where it currently is (unlike press-key which assumes it's on the home position).
;;; If the finger is currently being held release it before performing this movement.

;;;
;;; isa move-finger-to-home
;;;  hand [left | right]
;;;  finger [index | middle | ring | pinkie | thumb]
;;;
;;; Move the specified finger to its home position without pressing it.  If the finger
;;; is currently holding a key down release it before moving.  If the finger is already
;;; at the home position do nothing and print a warning.
;;;
;;; 
;;; isa all-fingers-to-home
;;;  {hand [left | right]}
;;;
;;; Move all fingers on the specified hand, or both hands if no hand specified,
;;; to their home positions.  Like move-finger-to-home any finger which is holding
;;; a key will be released first.  If all the fingers are on the home positions
;;; do nothing and print a warning.  This action has a fixed cost of 200ms.  It 
;;; does not move the hand(s) only the fingers.
;;;
;;;
;;; isa hold-mouse
;;;
;;; Execute a hold-punch with the right index finger to depress the primary mouse button.
;;; If the hand is not located on the mouse print a warning and do nothing.
;;;
;;;
;;; isa release-mouse
;;;
;;; Release the right index finger to release the primary mouse button.  If the 
;;; finger is not holding the button down or the hand is not located on the
;;; mouse do nothing and print a warning.
;;;
;;; isa release-all-fingers
;;; 
;;; Causes all fingers which are currently being held down to release.  The
;;; action doesn't jam and will wait until preparation is free to start the 
;;; action.  After the init time passes all fingers which are held will be 
;;; released after the key-release-time and then an additional burst cost will
;;; be applied before it is finished.

;;; Code to implement a replacement for the standard motor module
;;; which tracks the processor and execution stages separately for
;;; left and right hand actions.  There is still only one preparation
;;; stage for the whole module.
;;; 
;;; There isn't an easy way to "extend" the default module without
;;; replacing it since this changes some fundamental operations which
;;; can't just be provided through some new hooks into the default
;;; module.  
;;;
;;; Instead of undefining and creating a new one however, this is 
;;; going to be based on how it's actually defined (which means that
;;; changes to the module will still likely require changes here too).
;;; Do this by subclassing the motor-module class, redefine the creation
;;; function for the motor module to instantiate this class instead, 
;;; and then define the new and updated methods on that new class.
;;;
;;; The only functional difference is that now the proc-s and exec-s slots
;;; hold a list of two items (left and right) respectively instead of just one
;;; and actions for the exec-queue must have a hand specified (either left,
;;; right, or both).
;;;
;;; Also adding slots for holding the new parameters that are available
;;; for configuring the operation and adjusting the timing of the
;;; keypress actions as well as for holding the instance of the companion
;;; module for tracking the hands for convenience.

;;; attribute and should set that finger busy and free.
;;; 
;;; A finger based action will mark the finger as busy when the
;;; initiation starts (preparation completes) and free when it 
;;; finishes the movement.
;;;
;;; Whether the finger is up or down is handled by the set-finger-up
;;; and set-finger-down methods which should be called to send the
;;; actual notification to the device.
;;; 
;;; Add a method for computing the second execution time.
;;;
;;; Send the hand information to change-state.
;;;
;;; Make dummy requests to the manual-left and manual-right buffers
;;; as appropriate so that an action is recorded for the buffer trace.
;;;
;;; Indicate style and hand in the motor action events' output.
;;;
;;; The new slots are used as follows:
;;;
;;; two-exec-p defaults to nil, but if set to t indicates that the
;;; compute-second-exec-time method should be called.
;;;
;;; exec2-time stores the result of calling compute-second-exec-time.
;;;
;;; release-if-down indicates whether or not the finger used for
;;; the action should produce a release event if it is down when the
;;; execution of this action starts.  The possible values are:
