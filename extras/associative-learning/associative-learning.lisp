;;; Description : Reintroduce learning of Sji values with a new approach.
;;; 
;;; Bugs        : 
;;;
;;; To do       : [ ] Should it use Sji values that are set explicitly with
;;;                   add-sji to override the learned value?
;;;             : [ ] Should sdp report ALL "non-default" Sji values for a
;;;                   chunk instead of just those that were sources -- any
;;;                   chunk with some history is going to have an Sji that's
;;;                   different from the default but is that useful?
;;; 
;;; ----- History -----
;;; 2020.09.02 Dan [0.1]
;;;             : * First pass at implementation.
;;; 2020.09.22 Dan [0.2]
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the activation trace output for the Sji
;;;             :   calculation -- was showing Nj data instead of the Ni values.
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with merging time references when :ol is a
;;;             :   number.
;;;             : * Added the :opa parameter to provide an option in how the F
;;;             :   value is computed.
;;;             : * Only updated for a cleared buffer if it's enabled.
;;;             : * Added a slot to store a creation time for F (which could
;;;             :   be computed as the min of all chunks' creation times, but
;;;             :   for now just storing one).
;;; 2020.09.28 Dan [0.3]
;;;             : * Monitor :nsji and warn or force to 0 as indicated.
;;; 2020.10.30 Dan [0.4]
;;;             : * Add a replacement for get-all-chunk-sjis so that sdp will
;;;             :   show all the associations that aren't the default value for
;;;             :   the items with their current value.
;;;             : * Replace all instances of true-chunk-name as a key with the
;;;             :   version since it's being called as a function -- not sure
;;;             :   why those didn't error out...
;;;             : [0.5]
;;;             : * Now sdp also reports the Sji for the chunk to itself as well
;;;             :   even if it hasn't been a source.
;;;             : [0.6]
;;;             : * This is a significant change.  Replacing the parameters for
;;;             :   setting the priors.  Now there's :al-prior-p and 
;;;             :   :al-prior-w.  In addition to that instead of using the
;;;             :   approximation for P(Cj|Ni)/P(Cj|~Ni) use that directly and
;;;             :   compute the needed quantites by removing the relevant items
;;;             :   from the total history that's recorded (or partial in the
;;;             :   case of :ol being set).
;;;             : * Also added the parameter :al-show which shows the details
;;;             :   of computing the Sji values even if :act is off.
;;; 2020.11.04 Dan
;;;             : * Updated the documentation to appropriately describe the new
;;;             :   changes.
;;; 2021.10.18 Dan
;;;             : * Changed call to buffers to model-buffers instead.

;;;
;;; General Docs:
;;; 
;;; Implement the mechanism described in the Anderson_ACT-R-2020-workshop slides
;;; with these changes/clarifications:
;;;
;;; - Using P(Cj|Ni)/P(Cj|~Ni) instead of the approximation P(Ni|Cj)/P(Ni).
;;; That makes the Sji = log [(F(Ni&Cj)/F(Ni))/(F(~Ni&Cj)/F(~Ni))] not
;;; counting the new parameters for priors described below.
;;;
;;; - The decay will use the optimized learning formulas when they are enabled.
;;;
;;; - Instead of only the imaginal buffer, it applies to all buffers that have
;;; a non-zero activation spread at model definition time.  Any changes to the
;;; buffer spread paramters after the model is defined will not affect how this
;;; module operates with respect to those buffers i.e. if it was on but set to
;;; zero it's still going to be considered a source and if it was zero but set
;;; to non-zero it isn't going to be considered a source.
;;;
;;; - With respect to handling multiple source buffers, if multiple source 
;;; buffers are simultaneously cleared it will result in them not being 
;;; associated with each others' contents.  This is done for ease of 
;;; implementation at this point because without significant additional code 
;;; there would be ordering issues in such a situation (and that order isn't
;;; completely in the modeler's control or guaranteed to be consistent).  If 
;;; associating the contents of multiple simultaneously cleared source buffers
;;; is found to be needed, the module can be updated to handle that.
;;;
;;; - Instead of a single parameter for a prior value that gets added to all 
;;; of the F values, use a prior probability and a weight, which if they are
;;; called p and w respectively results in this equation for Sji:
;;; 
;;; Sji = log [((F(Ni&Cj) + pw)/(F(Ni) + w)) /((F(~Ni&Cj) + pw)/(F(~Ni) + w))]
;;;
;;;
;;; If the :act parameter is set then this module will display the details of 
;;; all the Sji calculations.
;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;
;;; Public API:
;;;
;;; Parameters:
;;;  :eal - enable associative learning
;;;         Set to the decay exponent to enable (.5 recomended)
;;;         Will automatically set :mas to a number to enable the
;;;         spreading activation calculation.
;;;  :al-prior-p - associate learning prior probability
;;;         the initial probability given to an association
;;;  :al-prior-w - associative learning prior weight
;;;         how much weight given to that prior value 
;;;  :al-show 
;;;         whether to display the details of the Sji calculations regardless
;;;         of the settings of :act (:v must also be true for the output to
;;;         actually be displayed)
;;;         
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;
;;; Design Choices:
;;; 
;;; Create a separate module for it instead of trying to modify the normal
;;; module.  Tie it in through the hook functions when enabled.  Use chunk
;;; parameters to store the needed values where possible.
;;;
;;; The contents of the source buffers that are upated when a retrieval request
;;; happens are the same ones that are used to compute the spreading activation.
;;; That means any changes the production with the request makes occur before
;;; the sources are determined i.e. modifications and buffer clearing.
;;; 
;;; Setting :mas to pi when :eal is set so that there's an easy check to see if
;;; it was automatically enabled so it can be turned off if :eal is set to nil
;;; (although turning things like :mas and :eal on/off after a model has been
;;; running isn't recommended).
