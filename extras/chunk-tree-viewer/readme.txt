This directory contains the documentation for an optional tool for use with 
the ACT-R Environment which provides a graphical representation of chunks
similar to the one developed by Andrea Heiberg, Jack Harris, and Jerry Ball 
as described in:

Heiberg, A., Harris, J. & Ball, J. (2007). Dynamic Visualization of ACT-R 
Declarative Memory Structure. In Proceedings of the 8th International 
Conference on Cognitive Modeling. July 27-29, 2007, Ann Arbor, Michigan 
(pp. 233 - 234). Oxford, UK: Taylor & Francis/Psychology Press.

which is also included as HeibergHarrisBall.pdf.

The tool is included with the Environment but disabled by default. To 
enable the tool you must rename a file in the environment/GUI/dialogs
directory of the ACT-R distribution (either the standalone or the source
code version).  The file named "35a-chunk-tree.tcx" must be renamed to
"35a-chunk-tree.tcl" before starting the Environment.  Doing so will
add a button called "Chunk Tree" to the Control Panel.  

The tree-viewer document in this directory describes how to use it.
