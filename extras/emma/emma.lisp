;;; Description : Implementation of Dario Salvucci's EMMA system for eye
;;;             : movements based on subclassing the Vision Module and making
;;;             : eye movements based on movement styles.
;;;
;;; Bugs        : 
;;;
;;; Todo        : [X] Solve "chunks created early" problem [requires some
;;;             :     rewriting of the Vision Module] - solved w/ACT-R 6.
;;;             : [ ] Tracking.
;;;             : [X] Fix the issue with the unrequested marking. - Not an issue
;;;             :     as of 8.0a1 since it's not replacing the current vision
;;;             :     functionality.
;;;             : [X] Make sure it works properly with respect to the chunk
;;;             :     deletion code now in the main module. - Not an issue
;;;             :     as of 8.0a1 since it's not replacing the current vision
;;;             :     functionality.
;;;             : [ ] Reevaluate the timing since it doesn't look like this
;;;             :     factored in the change from RPM to ACT-R 5 with an additional
;;;             :     50ms production firing (the attention shift time was dropped
;;;             :     from 135ms to 85ms to account for that), but maybe that 
;;;             :     doesn't matter.

;;;             :  Incept date.
;;; 01.05.09 mdb [r2]
;;;             : Fixed vector bugs.  Thanks, Dario.
;;; 01.05.?? Dario Salvucci [r3]
;;;             : Noise added to both X and Y of movement.
;;; 01.05.28 mdb [r4]
;;;             : Some minor tinkering with Dario's last changes.
;;; 01.07.02 mdb [r5]
;;;             : Made eye movement relative to next landing spot.
;;; 01.09.21 mdb [r6]
;;;             : Fixed bug in COMPLETE-EYE-MOVE.
;;; 01.10.01 mdb [r7]
;;;             : Added PROC-S method that's actually correct.
;;; 01.11.10 mdb
;;;             : Changed trace log to use CONS rather than LIST to save
;;;             : a smidge of memory, and made tracing the eye path switchable.
;;; 2002.05.04 [r8]
;;;             : Removed unnecessary PROC-STUB stuff.
;;; 2002.05.07 
;;;             : Fixed problem of FIND-LOCATION being clobbered by new preps.
;;;             : Renamed FOCUS-ON to ENCODING-COMPLETE.
;;; 2003.05.07 mdb [r9]
;;;             : Fixed MCL-specific checking. 
;;; 2003.06.23 mdb [r10]
;;;             : Made it easier and cleaner to hook into eye spot updating 
;;;             : for non-MCL Lisps by making a more generic function call 
;;;             : to which specific devices can be tailored, paralleling how
;;;             : it's done for attended location. 
;;;             : Based the EYE-SPOT class on the new RPM-OVERLAY class from
;;;             : the 2.1.3 version of "mcl-device.lisp".
;;; 2003.07.17 mdb [r11]
;;;             : Added a CLEAR :after method to kill any in-progress shift
;;;             : and stripped some dead code.
;;;
;;; 2005.08.10 mjs 
;;;             : Made numerous changes to create an ACT-R 6.0 version. Changes
;;;             : are indicated by the initials mjs.deleted input-q references
;;;             : changed scheduling to  ACT-R 6 scheduling
;;;             : delete preparation-complete from event queue if one is outstanding
;;;             : when moving attention
;;;             : uses ACT-R 6.0 noise
;;;             : no pm- in top-level names
;;;             : redefines Vision Module for EMMA
;;; 2006.07.27 Dan
;;;             : * Added the code needed to draw the blue dot in ACL.
;;;             : * Took the "chunks created early" problem off of to do and
;;;             :   bugs because I'm pretty sure that's not an issue in 6.
;;;             : * Also added the package switches that are in all the other
;;;             :   module files for those that use them.
;;; 2006.09.08 Dan
;;;             : * Changed parameter checks from posnum to nonneg.
;;; 2007.03.16 Dan
;;;             : * Changed add-gaussian-noise to catch when there was 0 
;;;             :   deviation because can't generate a noise of 0.
;;; 2007.04.02 Dan
;;;             : * Minor tweak to the test in add-gaussian-noise because for
;;;             :   really small values of stdev (1*10^-23 for shorts) the old
;;;             :   fix still could have resulted in an error.
;;; 2007.06.25 Dan
;;;             : * Added a test to all the schedule-event-relative calls so that
;;;             :   they are never negative - I don't know which one was actually
;;;             :   the problem so I put a check in all of them.
;;; 2007.06.26 Dan
;;;             : * Modified the #+version> checks in the Allegro based code
;;;             :   because even though they're protected with a #+:allegro CLisp
;;;             :   still seems to break on reading them.
;;; 2007.11.05 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed the #+ checks that were modified with the last
;;;             :   update because I broke them with respect to ACL.
;;; 2007.11.15 Dan
;;;             : * Added a device-update-eye-loc method for the environment
;;;             :   visible-virtual windows.
;;;             :   To use that you need to have EMMA loaded after the environment
;;;             :   which means this file should go in other-files and not tools,
;;;             :   commands, or modules.
;;; 2007.11.20 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in object-frequency because stringp doesn't 
;;;             :   necessarily return the string itself for true.
;;; 2007.11.20 Dan [4.0a1]
;;;             : * Started to rework for use with the new vision module.
;;; 2007.11.21 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the ACL display code that was still referring
;;;             :   to *mp*.
;;; 2007.11.21 Dan
;;;             : * Added a parameter (:vis-obj-freq) to set the default frequency value.
;;; 2007.11.28 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in move-attention so that when the target object
;;;             :   is no longer available there is still a scheduling of the
;;;             :   encoding complete to trigger the error and set the module back
;;;             :   to the free state.
;;; 2007.12.21 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the LispWorks code for the eye-spot to make it a
;;;             :   subclass of focus-ring to avoid an error for not having an
;;;             :   appropriate update-me method, but it doesn't draw and I don't
;;;             :   really know enough capi code to make the necessary changes to
;;;             :   the device file...
;;; 2008.04.24 Dan
;;;             : * Updated with the recent changes to the main vision module.
;;;             : * Added the requested keyword parameter to encoding-complete
;;;             :   so it doesn't complain when loaded, but it doesn't work
;;;             :   right with the emma module - unrequested attention shifts
;;;             :   will not be marked as such in the buffer because emma uses
;;;             :   move-attention to do so.  Will require modifying move-attention
;;;             :   both in emma and the core module.
;;;             : * Added the :test-feats parameter to the module definition.
;;;             : * Did not add :auto-attend because that doesn't seem like
;;;             :   the sort of thing that one would want when using emma and
;;;             :   it could lead to problems with the timing.
;;; 2008.07.08 Dan
;;;             : * Updated update-attended-loc to work right now that the
;;;             :   visicon chunks get deleted.  May need to fix other places
;;;             :   as well.
;;; 2008.07.15 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a cut-and-paste error introduced with the last fix.
;;; 2008.09.17 Dan
;;;             : * Updated the LispWorks code for drawing the fixation spot
;;;             :   to match with the new device code from LispWorks.
;;; 2010.05.03 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the :output of the "No visual-object found" event
;;;             :   from 'high to 'medium since that's how it has always printed
;;;             :   anyway because of a bug in filter-test.
;;; 2011.04.28 Dan
;;;             : * Suppress warnings about extending chunks at initial load.
;;; 2011.05.16 Dan
;;;             : * Replaced pm-warning calls with model-warning.
;;; 2011.05.19 Dan
;;;             : * Changed mp-time calls to mp-time-ms calls and adjusted
;;;             :   as needed.
;;; 2011.06.17 Dan
;;;             : * Took the ":exec 'free" out of encoding-complete's state change
;;;             :   since that shouldn't happen.
;;; 2012.07.02 Dan [4.0a2]
;;;             : * Update to support one eye-spot per model in multiple window
;;;             :   and/or multiple model situations.  Like the fixation marker
;;;             :   there is a function called eye-spot-marker which can be used
;;;             :   to store the current marker instead of the *eye-spot* variable.
;;;             :   Like device-update-attended-loc the device-update-eye-loc
;;;             :   method will now occasionally get called with nil to indicate
;;;             :   that the marker should be erased.
;;;             : * Only show the eye spot when show-focus-p is true.
;;;             : * Add a modified install-device so that it can call the 
;;;             :   device-update-eye-loc method when the model switches devices
;;;             :   and always start eyes at location 0,0 when a device is installed.
;;;             : * Also updating some other code that seems to have been neglected
;;;             :   along the way (particularly the :delete-visicon-chunks,
;;;             :   :scene-change-threshold, and :viewing-distance parameters).
;;; 2012.09.07 Dan
;;;             : * Adding an eye spot for CCL since there's now a device for it.
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the environment version of the eye-spot code.
;;; 2013.01.09 Dan
;;;             : * Replaced the #@ in the CCL code with make-point since that 
;;;             :   causes problems in all other Lisps even inside the #+CCL...
;;;             : * Removed the clearing of the eye-spot from the reset function
;;;             :   since install-device handles that and it's important that an
;;;             :   "old" spot persist to that it can be erased from the previous
;;;             :   device.
;;; 2013.09.26 Dan
;;;             : * To keep the display code separate from the model actions
;;;             :   using an after method on update-device to draw the eye-loc
;;;             :   instead of calling it from set-eye-loc.
;;; 2014.02.14 Dan [4.1]
;;;             : * Updated with the changes to the vision module to make
;;;             :   distance for visual locations be in pixels.
;;; 2014.03.17 Dan [5.0]
;;;             : * Changed the query-buffer call to be consistent with the new
;;;             :   internal code.
;;; 2014.07.07 Dan [6.0]
;;;             : * Updated for ACT-R 6.1.
;;; 2015.03.20 Dan
;;;             : * Attend failure sets the buffer failure flag using set-buffer-failure.
;;; 2015.03.23 Dan
;;;             : * The visual buffer failures are now marked as to whether it
;;;             :   was a requested encoding or an automatic one which failed.
;;; 2015.05.20 Dan
;;;             : * Updated the calls to xy-loc to include the module to allow
;;;             :   for the use of device specific coordinate slots instead of just
;;;             :   screen-x, screen-y, and distance.
;;; 2015.06.05 Dan
;;;             : * Schedule all events in ms now.
;;; 2015.07.28 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the logical to ACT-R-support in the require-compiled.
;;; 2015.07.30 Dan [6.1]
;;;             : * Added the unstuffing/overwriting params and actions.
;;; 2015.08.13 Dan
;;;             : * Changed all rand-time calls to randomize-time.
;;; 2015.09.23 Dan [7.0]
;;;             : * Completing the requests to the visual buffer for the new utility
;;;             :   learning credit assignment mechanism.  
;;;             :   One issue is that complete-eye-move gets called at multiple
;;;             :   points in the task so it can't be used to actually complete
;;;             :   the request even though it's a movement style and would do so
;;;             :   "automatically".  Instead, just use encoding-complete like 
;;;             :   the standard vision module to mark the request done since the
;;;             :   current module's request function is still called which sets
;;;             :   the last request slot of the module.
;;; 2016.03.14 Dan
;;;             : * Added the provide at the bottom for use with require-extra.
;;; 2016.07.08 Dan [7.1]
;;;             : * Added the new :tracking-clear parameter from the vision module.
;;; 2016.07.20 Dan
;;;             : * Updated things to use set-current-marker and clof where it was
;;;             :   taking (xy-loc current-marker) to deal with potentially 
;;;             :   deleted feature chunk issues.
;;;             : * Update encoding-complete and all the calls to it because it
;;;             :   takes an extra parameter for location vector.
;;;             : * Updated the calls to get-obj-at-location since it also takes
;;;             :   the vector now too.
;;; 2016.11.17 Dan
;;;             : * Fix the redefinition of open-exp-window to use current-mp.
;;; 2018.09.06 Dan [8.0a1]
;;;             : * Start of updates for 7.x.
;;;             : * Making it its own module now, and going to implement it 
;;;             :   through mechanisms that need to be added to vision module
;;;             :   (hooks, monitors, device?).
;;; 2018.09.18 Dan
;;;             : * Using the attn-module as the parent class, and then using the
;;;             :   current-marker to hold the position, last-prep instead of prep-
;;;             :   event, and the param-lock for everything.
;;; 2018.09.19 Dan
;;;             : * Add a parameter to control whether it is enabled or not.
;;;             : * Set the default values for the factor and exponent to those
;;;             :   used in the paper.
;;;             : * Set the default frequency to .1 as used for numbers and letters
;;;             :   in the paper.  That means with the other default parameters a 
;;;             :   saccade of 4.5 dva (about 85 pixels on the default AGI windows)
;;;             :   has an encoding that takes ~85ms (the default visual encoding
;;;             :   time): 
;;;             :   > (* .006 (- (log .1)) (exp (* .4 4.5)))
;;;             :   0.083578974
;;; 2018.09.21 Dan
;;;             : * Added parameters for the slot to use in the visual objects
;;;             :   to determine frequency, to set the init time of the 
;;;             :   saccades, and to set the feature prep cost of saccades.
;;;             : * Set-eye-loc notifies the devices of the position -- there's
;;;             :   always an eye position even if attention is cleared.
;;;             : * Can't use last-prep since that's part of the general pm
;;;             :   style handling code so need to put prep-event back in.
;;;             : * Generate a signal for monitoring purposes when the eye
;;;             :   moves called "current-eye-location" passed the new x and y
;;;             :   values.
;;; 2018.09.24 Dan
;;;             : * Don't need to distinguish whether there's an object there or
;;;             :   not -- absence of a target just means default frequency at
;;;             :   this point.  May want a separate parameter for that in the
;;;             :   future.
;;;             : * Need to handle state error queries since the generic method
;;;             :   doesn't.
;;; 2019.02.22 Dan  [8.1a1]
;;;             : * Don't throw out the z component in the current marker, and 
;;;             :   just compute the angles instead of going to pixels for the
;;;             :   distances.  Assuming no noise in z dimension and that there's
;;;             :   no additional cost for change in z -- the subtended angle is
;;;             :   all that matters.
;;;             : * Sending all three values to the set-eye-loc command, and
;;;             :   assuming default distance when only two values provided to
;;;             :   set-eye-location.
;;;             : * The eyeloc signal now also gets all three.
;;;             : * Switched to using tertiary reset to get ppi and viewing
;;;             :   distance after model params set.
;;;             : * Don't compute r-theta and saccade separately, just create
;;;             :   the saccade immediately and store the target point in it
;;;             :   (using a num-to-prepare to ingore the extra feature).
;;; 2020.01.10 Dan [8.1a2]
;;;             : * Removed the #' and lambdas from the module interface 
;;;             :   functions since that's not allowed in the general system
;;;             :   now.
;;; 2020.08.26 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the path for require-compiled since it's not needed
;;;             :   and results in warnings in SBCL.
;;; 2022.03.24 Dan [8.2a1]
;;;             : * Realized that there were two different current-eye-location
;;;             :   commands -- the signal it generates when the position
