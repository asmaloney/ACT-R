;;; Bugs        : 
;;;
;;; To do       : * Finish the documentation.
;;;             : * Investigate optimizations after there's some use.
;;;             : * Add a function to check chunk-specs to make module writing
;;;             :   easier.
;;; ----- History -----
;;;
;;; 2004.09.02 Dan
;;;             : Creation.
;;; 2004.12.29 Dan
;;;             : Realized that the comparitors are backwards with respect
;;;             : to productions in test-chunk-slots.
;;; 2005.02.03 Dan
;;;             : * Changing the internal slot-value-lists of a chunk to be a
;;;             :   hash-table instead of an alist...
;;; 2005.02.09 Dan
;;;             : * Some minor cleanup - changing member to find where possible.
;;; 2005.04.19 Dan
;;;             : * Added pprint-chunk-spec.
;;; 2005.05.16 Dan
;;;             : * Modified chunk-spec-variable-p to test that the name has
;;;             :   a length > 1 to reject the symbol itself as a variable.
;;;             :   That fixes a minor problem in production parsing and I
;;;             :   don't think it breaks anything else.
;;; 2005.09.09 Dan
;;;             : * Renamed chunk-to-chunk-spec chunk-name-to-chunk-spec to
;;;             :   clarify its use because I introduced a bug somewhere
;;;             :   along the line with its usage that didn't actually affect
;;;             :   any existing modules, but may cause problems for other
;;;             :   module writers.
;;;             : * Also fixed chunk-name-to-chunk-spec because it didn't 
;;;             :   include nil slots in the spec, but it probably should (it
;;;             :   did prior to my "fixing" it when I changed over to hash
;;;             :   tables).
;;; 2005.11.17 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed chunk-name-to-chunk-spec because it incorrectly
;;;             :   referenced the internal chunk-type slot list instead of
;;;             :   using ct-slot-names.
;;; 2006.09.11 Dan
;;;             : * Changed chunk-slot-equal so that it uses equalp instead of
;;;             :   equal when the string and chunk checks fall through because
;;;             :   numbers (which is the typical value that'd fall through)
;;;             :   don't test well with equal...
;;; 2007.06.18 Dan
;;;             : * Added slot-specs-to-chunk-spec-list and chunk-spec-to-chunk-def
;;;             :   as "official" commands now and also added slot-specs-to-chunk-spec
;;;             :   which removes the need to call define-chunk-spec after slot-specs-
;;;             :   to-chunk-spec-list.
;;; 2007.07.02 Dan
;;;             : * Changed PROCESS-SLOTS-SPECS so that it keeps the slot-spec
;;;             :   in the order provided during definition.
;;; 2007.08.07 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed pprint-chunk-spec so that it actually has the : on the
;;;             :   front of the request parameters.
;;; 2008.06.16 Dan
;;;             : * Changed test-chunk-slots so that it always fails if there
;;;             :   are unbound variables even when they're used in other 
;;;             :   tests.  Doesn't change the normal operation, just shuts
;;;             :   down the possibility of "odd" chunk-specs doing unusual
;;;             :   matches that result in a true result.
;;; 2008.06.17 Dan
;;;             : * Changed test-chunk-slots so that it ignores request parameters
;;;             :   in the chunk-spec for matching purposes.
;;;             : * Added tests for current model and mp to match-chunk-spec-p.
;;; 2008.06.18 Dan
;;;             : * Added a test to find-matching-chunks to verify that the 
;;;             :   chunks parameter is a list when it's not :all.
;;;             : * Fixed the warning in chunk-spec-slot-spec to name the right
;;;             :   function.
;;; 2008.06.20 Dan
;;;             : * Changed chunk-spec-to-chunk-def so that tests to make sure
;;;             :   the parameter is a chunk-spec.
;;;             : * Changed chunk-spec-to-chunk-def so that it also rejects a
;;;             :   spec with request parameters.
;;;             : * Removed the macros of slot-specs-to-chunk-spec-list and
;;;             :   slot-specs-to-chunk-spec and renamed the functions to not
;;;             :   have the -fct since none of the other chunk-spec manipulation
;;;             :   commands use that convention and they aren't the types of
;;;             :   things that would be entered 'directly' and need a macro
;;;             :   form.
;;; 2008.07.31 Dan
;;;             : * Took chunk-slot-equal out of here and put it into the chunks
;;;             :   file.
;;; 2008.10.30 Dan
;;;             : * Performance improvement for test-chunk-slots - fewer loops
;;;             :   over the spec/slots.
;;; 2013.01.28 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the internal storing of the chunk-type to the name
;;;             :   since that's what got used anyway and changed process-slots-specs
;;;             :   to call valid-chunk-type-slot instead (which is the command
;;;             :   it really should have been using anyway) and similarly don't
;;;             :   use the internal chunk/chunk-type accessors in chunk-name-to-chunk-spec.
;;; 2013.02.14 Dan
;;;             : * Changed strip-request-parameters-from-chunk-spec so that it
;;;             :   maintains the ordering of the slots and removed an unneeded
;;;             :   cond from chunk-spec-slot-spec.
;;; 2013.03.13 Dan [1.1]
;;;             : * Changed process-slots-specs so that it allows a parent type
;;;             :   to specify slots of child types in chunk-specs.
;;;             : * Changed test-chunk-slots so that it requires that a chunk
;;;             :   have the specified slot as well as matching its value --
;;;             :   not having the slot is not the same as having the slot with
;;;             :   a value of nil.
;;; 2013.03.18 Dan 
;;;             : * Fixed some order dependence issues in test-chunk-slots.
;;; 2013.06.07 Dan
;;;             : * Changed test-chunk-slots so that it now requires a parameter
;;;             :   indicating whether the chunk is static or not because now a
;;;             :   static chunk which doesn't have a particular slot will match
;;;             :   to a spec which says "= <that slot> nil" because for statics
;;;             :   not having a slot is the same as having a slot with an explict
;;;             :   value of nil.
;;; 2014.02.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in test-chunk-slots with how it tests variables
;;;             :   between slots that was broken with the 13/3/13 change.
;;; 2014.03.03 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Conversion to the no chunk-types at run time mechanism.  A
;;;             :   chunk-spec now holds two vectors of slot info (filled and empty)
;;;             :   instead of a type symbol.
;;;             : * Chunk-spec-chunk-type returns nil and prints a warning.
;;;             : * Chunk-spec-filled-slots and chunk-spec-empty-slots return 
;;;             :   the corresponding vectors for comparison purposes.
;;;             : * The isa is optional when defining a chunk-spec but if provided 
;;;             :   starts with the default spec for the type, but overwrites 
;;;             :   any default values with those provided in the spec.
;;; 2014.03.14 Dan
;;;             : * Treat request parameters like slots in a chunk-spec, but not
;;;             :   in chunks.
;;; 2014.03.19 Dan
;;;             : * Allow a chunk-spec to have variablized slot names, add an
;;;             :   instantiate-chunk-spec command, and require that matching a
;;;             :   chunk-spec only uses the "instantiated" slot specs.
;;;             : * Remove the warning when a chunk-spec-slot-spec gets a slot
;;;             :   that's not specified to avoid the need for pre-checking the
;;;             :   slots everywhere that's used, and do the same for the 
;;;             :   slot-in-chunk-spec-p function as well.
;;; 2014.03.20 Dan
;;;             : * Let define-chunk-spec-fct extend chunks automatically with
;;;             :   optional parameters that indicate if it can and if it should
;;;             :   print a warning when it does.
;;;             : * Now returns 2 values: the spec and a list of slots that were
;;;             :   added by extension.
;;; 2014.03.26 Dan
;;;             : * Don't allow modifiers for request parameters i.e. they must
;;;             :   have an = modifier.
;;; 2014.03.27 Dan
;;;             : * Added merge-chunk-specs command.
;;; 2014.03.28 Dan
;;;             : * Instantiate-chunk-spec now returns two values like define-
;;;             :   chunk-spec.
;;; 2014.04.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added the functions for comparing a chunk/slot-vector to
;;;             :   the filled and empty specs so I don't need to do the bit
;;;             :   tests directly everywhere.
;;; 2014.04.07 Dan
;;;             : * Moved chunk-spec-variable-p to misc-utils.
;;; 2014.05.08 Dan
;;;             : * Adding the structure spec-slot to allow for more cleanly
;;;             :   accessing the components of a slot specification.  However,
;;;             :   they are still represented as lists this just provides 
;;;             :   accessors to treat the list as a struct.
;;; 2014.05.19 Dan
;;;             : * Putting slot-specs-to-chunk-spec back in because vision and
;;;             :   audio can use such a function.
;;; 2014.06.09 Dan
;;;             : * Changed a warning so that it matches the older version.
;;; 2014.06.11 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed some logic in add-slot-spec-to-chunk-spec so that the
;;;             :   backward compatibility flag properly indicates how to deal
;;;             :   with a - slot <val> condition in a chunk-spec.
;;; 2014.06.12 Dan
;;;             : * Reevaluated the logic in how matching nil slots should work
;;;             :   under various conditions and decided that it should be the
;;;             :   same with or without the backward compat. flag because we
;;;             :   don't want to capture the "odd" behavior of 6.0 rejecting
;;;             :   a non-existant slot.
;;; 2014.06.24 Dan
;;;             : * Allow the definition of a chunk-spec which uses an isa and
;;;             :   slots which don't belong to that type, but print a hard
;;;             :   warning.
;;; 2014.09.05 Dan
;;;             : * Add extra tests to process-slots-specs when trying to extend
;;;             :   with a new slot because with allowing 'bad' slots as above
;;;             :   it has to be sure bad values are at least valid as a slot 
;;;             :   name first.
;;; 2014.11.04 Dan
;;;             : * Added model and meta-process checks to pprint-chunk-spec.
;;;             : * Starting to fix issues with the match and find code to deal
;;;             :   with the fact that variables are now allowed in the slot name
;;;             :   positions of chunk-specs.  Isn't a problem for the current
;;;             :   code that uses chunk-specs since conflict resolution doesn't 
;;;             :   rely on it and things like visicon searches which use vars
;;;             :   only do so in the value spot, but it should do the "right"
;;;             :   thing for all usage.
;;; 2014.11.05 Dan
;;;             : * Match-chunk-spec-p now works for arbitrary depth slot name
;;;             :   bindings when using the default variable character.
;;; 2014.11.06 Dan
;;;             : * Match-chunk-spec-p works fully with other variable characters
;;;             :   though it can be tough to take advantage of that since slot
;;;             :   names need to be valid during the definition of the chunk-spec.
;;;             : * Changed slot-in-chunk-spec-p to return t when it's a varaible
;;;             :   now too.
;;;             : * Added the slot-spec-* accessors to go along with spec-slot
;;;             :   since they better match the description in the manual and are
;;;             :   safer since they don't throw an error if non-list provided.
;;;             : * Fixed chunk-spec-to-chunk-def to fail if there are variablized
;;;             :   slots in the chunk-spec.
;;;             : * Safety check added to verify-single-explicit-value.
;;; 2014.12.16 Dan
;;;             : * Don't use the list structure trick to define the spec-slot-*
;;;             :   accessors since not all Lisps like that when passed nil.
;;;             :   Instead just make it functions calling first, second, and
;;;             :   third with no error checking (also was true for the struct
;;;             :   accessors) along with corresponding setf forms.
;;; 2015.08.19 Dan
;;;             : * Added the chunk-difference-to-chunk-spec function which 
;;;             :   returns a chunk-spec with the modifications necessary to
;;;             :   turn the second chunk into a copy of the first.  Needed by
;;;             :   visual tracking because with nil slots not being part of a
;;;             :   chunk now chunk-name-to-chunk-spec isn't sufficient if the
;;;             :   first chunk doesn't have a slot the second.  May be useful
;;;             :   in other places as well.
;;; 2017.06.20 Dan
;;;             : * Locking access to the model's chunk table for find-matching-
;;;             :   chunks.
;;; 2017.06.21 Dan
;;;             : * Lock a chunk when accessing its internal slots.
;;; 2017.08.09 Dan
;;;             : * Added the printed-chunk-spec command to provide an alternative
;;;             :   for capture-model-output which doesn't work in an RPC world.
;;; 2017.09.28 Dan
;;;             : * Added an optional parameter to printed-chunk-spec to have it
;;;             :   printed to a 'flat' string instead of embedding the new lines
;;;             :   and production spacing.
;;; 2017.12.06 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Adding a component to hold a table of chunk-specs since a
;;;             :   remote call can't use the internal struct.  Instead cache
;;;             :   the struct in the table and return a # as the chunk-spec-id
;;;             :   instead.  Need to provide a 'release' mechanism too since
;;;             :   otherwise the table could get large before a reset/clearall
;;;             :   can flush it.
;;; 2018.06.06 Dan
;;;             : * Added a remote define-chunk-spec-fct.
;;;             : * Chunk-spec-to-id tests that it's actually given a chunk-spec.
;;;             : * Don't throw an error for bad remote define-chunk-spec calls.
;;;             :   Just return nil since there'll already be a warning.
;;;             : * Added a remote chunk-name-to-chunk-spec and pprint-chunk-spec.
;;; 2018.06.07 Dan
;;;             : * Added a remote match-chunk-spec-p, allow commands for the
;;;             :   test functions, and do a little more parameter checking.
;;;             : * Added remote find-matching-chunks, chunk-spec-slots, slot-in-
;;;             :   chunk-spec-p, chunk-spec-slot-spec, slot-spec-modifier,
;;;             :   slot-spec-slot, slot-spec-value.
;;; 2018.06.08 Dan
;;;             : * Added a remote chunk-spec-variable-p here since the
;;;             :   original is in misc-utils which gets loaded before the
;;;             :   dispatcher.
;;;             : * Verify-single-explicit-value now always returns 2 values 
;;;             :   since that's safer for use remotely, and added a remote
;;;             :   command for it.
;;;             : * Added remote chunk-difference-to-chunk-spec and printed-
;;;             :   chunk-spec.
;;; 2018.06.11 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with chunk-spec-slots introduced with that last
;;;             :   update.
;;; 2018.06.12 Dan
;;;             : * Work to make sure things are consistent with respect to when
;;;             :   special string handling is used.
;;;             : * Use the new process-options-list function from the dispatcher
;;;             :   to handle remote 'keyword-like' parameters and update the doc
;;;             :   strings accordingly.
;;; 2018.06.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug when there's an alternate variable char to match-
;;;             :   chunk-spec-p.
;;; 2019.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed some copy and paste issues with warnings and removed
;;;             :   all the verify-current-meta-process checks.
;;;             : * Use a separate list of testable chunk-specs instead of doing
;;;             :   a check on a testable flag.
;;; 2019.02.13 Dan
;;;             : * Add a comment with an alternate test for slots-vector-match-
;;;             :   signature.
;;; 2019.03.06 Dan
;;;             : * Adjust how act-r-chunk-slot-value-lists is used since its
;;;             :   first elements are slot structs.
;;; 2019.04.04 Dan
;;;             : * Take advantage of slot-struct being returned by tests to
;;;             :   simplify some code.
;;;             : * Instantiating a chunk-spec always calls replace-variables
;;;             :   on the value because it could be a list which wouldn't have
