;;; 2004.10.07 Dan
;;;             : Created.
;;; 2005.01.05 Dan
;;;             : Changed the version on the meta-process so that it indicates
;;;             : the svn revision because it's going to be used to create a
;;;             : snapshot for the website.
;;; 2005.01.10 Dan
;;;             : Same as above - added r20 and this time it's actually going
;;;             : out to the site!
;;; 2005.01.12 Dan
;;;             : Because device is becoming a module it doesn't need to be
;;;             : a slot in the model.
;;; 2005.01.15 Dan

;;;             :   need to hide the details.
;;; 2005.01.21 Dan

;;;             :   for use wth the detail level.
;;; 2005.02.11 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the make-hash-tables in the chunk structure to
;;;             :   limit the size to just a little bigger than needed and

;;; 2005.04.14 Dan
;;;             : * Added the suppress-cmds slot to the printing module to get
;;;             :   around a problem with no-output and trying to read the :cmdt
;;;             :   parameter...

;;;             : * Oops, mis-encoded the file with mac line endings, so
;;;             :   now changing to [r145].
;;; 2005.09.01 Dan
;;;             : * Taking the [r145] off.
;;; 2005.09.08 Dan
;;;             : * Added the model-warnings slot to the printing module

;;;             : * Changing framework version to 1.1.
;;; 2006.01.18 Dan
;;;             : * Added the extended-slots slot to the chunk-type structure
;;;             :   so that one can differentiate between the original slots
;;;             :   and any that are added on the fly.
;;;             : * Added the show-all-slots slot to the printing module to hold
;;;             :   the new parameter.
;;; 2006.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Adding the maintenance event type for use in things like
;;;             :   terminating events and periodic events.  The schedule-event-
;;;             :   after functions will have a keyword that specifies whether
;;;             :   or not to consider maintenance events that defaults to nil.
;;; 2006.02.27 Dan
;;;             : * Added slots to the meta-process to handle the configuration

;;; 2006.03.15 Dan
;;;             : * Changed version to [r216] for web release.
;;; 2006.03.15 Dan

;;; 2006.03.21 Dan
;;;             : * Changed version to [r220] for web release.
;;; 2006.03.28 Dan
;;;             : * Changed version to [r222] for web release.
;;; 2006.03.28 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the [r222].
;;; 2006.07.10 Dan
;;;             : * Changed version to [r248] for web release.
;;; 2006.07.10 Dan

;;; 2006.11.20 Dan
;;;             : * Added the warn slot to the act-r-module structure.
;;; 2007.01.15 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the version setting in the meta-process structure
;;;             :   to be the value of *actr-version-string* so that I don't
;;;             :   have to touch this file to mark the version changes.
;;; 2007.04.13 Dan
;;;             : * Added a new slot to the printing module struct to hold
;;;             :   the cbct parameter.
;;; 2008.10.20 Dan
;;;             : * Added new slots to the model structure to hold the flags
;;;             :   for normalizing.
;;; 2008.11.03 Dan
;;;             : * Updated the chunk and chunk parameter structures to work 
;;;             :   with the new array representation of the parameters.
;;; 2008.11.13 Dan
;;;             : * Added the dynamic-update-hooks slot to the model struct.
;;; 2008.12.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added the tertiary-reset slot to the module structure.
;;; 2008.12.08 Dan
;;;             : * Added the the largest-chunk-type slot to the model struct
;;;             :   to keep track of the largest possible chunk size.
;;; 2008.12.10 Dan
;;;             : * Added the copy-from-chunk slot to the chunk parameter
;;;             :   struct.
;;; 2009.02.13 Dan
;;;             : * Added the base-name slot to chunks to support the new
;;;             :   short copy names.
;;;             : * Added the short-copy-names slot to the model structure too.
;;; 2009.04.29 Dan
;;;             : * Adding a slot to the meta-process so I can detect recursive
;;;             :   calls to run and signal a warning.
;;; 2009.09.09 Dan
;;;             : * Added the multi, searchable and chunk-set slots to the buffer 
;;;             :   struct.
;;; 2009.12.03 Dan
;;;             : * Adding the dynamics, allow-dynamics, and in-slack to the meta-process 
;;;             :   to provide more flexibility with real-time when a slack-hook 
;;;             :   is used and add the dynamic tag to events.
;;; 2010.01.14 Dan
;;;             : * Adding the copy slot to the buffer struct.
;;; 2010.09.02 Dan
;;;             : * Added a slot to the meta-process to record whether or not the
;;;             :   time overflow warning has been displayed or not.
;;; 2010.11.03 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the event structure's time slot to be mstime because
;;;             :   that's what will be used elsewhere.  To go with that have
;;;             :   added an evt-time function which makes the conversion to
;;;             :   keep the API right.
;;; 2010.12.22 Dan
;;;             : * Added a run-notify slot to the module structures to support
;;;             :   the new run-notify option for modules.
;;; 2011.01.11 Dan
;;;             : * Added a run-over-notify slot to the module structures since
;;;             :   a module may want to know about both situations.
;;; 2011.03.25 Dan
;;;             : * Added a safety check to evt-time so that if there's not a
;;;             :   time it doesn't throw an error.
;;; 2011.04.01 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the initial value for the meta-process time to be 0 
;;;             :   instead of 0.0.
;;; 2012.08.08 Dan
;;;             : * Adding another slot to the meta-process so that it can 
;;;             :   record the order in which models are defined so that they
;;;             :   can be reset in that same order for consistency.
;;; 2013.01.03 Dan
;;;             : * Adding a max-time-maintenance slot to the meta-process.
;;; 2013.01.04 Dan
;;;             : * Added the cannot-define-model slot to the meta-process to
;;;             :   provide a way of avoiding a nasty situation that can occur
;;;             :   if something tries to create a model while the "current" 
;;;             :   model is being changed for other reasons.  Now, anytime there's
;;;             :   a (setf (meta-p-current-model ...)) it should be wrapped in
;;;             :   a (cannot-define-model ...) construct since that macro sets
;;;             :   and clears this slot.
;;; 2013.01.07 Dan
;;;             : * Changed cannot-define-model to be a count since t/nil doesn't
;;;             :   work since cannot-define-model macros could be nested.
;;; 2013.01.24 Dan
;;;             : * Adding a new slot to the chunk-type structure to keep track
;;;             :   of an index for slots because the production matching code
;;;             :   builds an array of bufferXslot values but chunk extension
;;;             :   mixed with subtyping can cause issues with that.
;;; 2013.01.28 Dan
;;;             : * Adding another new slot to the chunk-type structure: possible-slots.
;;;             :   That will hold the names of slots in subtypes of a type but
;;;             :   not members of the type itself.  Needed to allow for the
;;;             :   ability to specify subtype slots in conditions as constants
;;;             :   which seems to follow as a logical conclusion, but which hasn't
;;;             :   been implemented previously.
;;; 2013.05.17 Dan [1.2]
;;;             : * Added new slots to the chunk-type structure to indicate
;;;             :   and manage the new static chunk-types which create 
;;;             :   subtypes instead of growing the base type when extended.
;;; 2013.10.02 Dan
;;;             : * Took the # off of the setting for the default break event
;;;             :   action since that function isn't defined at this point.
;;; 2014.02.12 Dan
;;;             : * Added the user-defined slot to chunk-types for use with
;;;             :   printing 'cannonical' names of types based on the added
;;;             :   option of defined for the :show-static-subtype-names param.
;;; 2014.02.17 Dan
;;;             : * Added the creation-type slot to chunks to allow things like
;;;             :   this to still work with static chunks:
;;;             :    (chunk-type foo)
;;;             :    (chunk-type (bar (:include foo)) slot)
;;;             :    (define-chunks (a isa bar))
;;;             :    (set-chunk-slot-value a slot t)
;;; 2014.02.24 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Chunks no longer maintain a chunk-type, just a vector of filled
;;;             :   slots and now an immutable tag since changing DM chunks 
;;;             :   will really be a problem without types to organize things.
;;;             : * Chunk-types don't have a static specifier since they aren't
;;;             :   really used at run time and don't need to maintain a lot
;;;             :   of info.
;;;             : * Instead there's a structure for the model which holds the
;;;             :   chunk-type info instead of just a table of types.
;;;             : * Chunk-specs now have filled slot and empty slot vectors 
;;;             :   instead of a type.
;;; 2014.03.13 Dan
;;;             : * Chunk-specs now hold more details directly: 
;;;             :    - which slots have multiple specifications
;;;             :    - which slots have inequality tests
;;;             :    - which slots have equality tests
;;;             :    - which slots have negation tests
;;;             :    - any potential variable markers in slot tests (non alphanumericp
;;;             :      initial characters)
;;; 2014.03.14 Dan
;;;             : * Request parameters get treated just like slots in a chunk-spec
;;;             :   which means that they will need to be added as slots when 
;;;             :   defined with modules.  Keep track of them in the spec for
;;;             :   comparing a chunk-spec to a chunk-type signature.
;;; 2014.05.14 Dan
;;;             : * Maintain query info separately in the chunk-type-info struct.
;;; 2014.06.24 Dan
;;;             : * Chunk-types don't need to record subtypes info now.
;;;             : * Do want to record the specific parent types given, if any.
;;; 2014.06.25 Dan
;;;             : * Record the chunk-type names as they're created in the chunk-
;;;             :   type-info struct so that printing them out is consistent
;;;             :   among Lisps and so they don't need to be ordered by inheritance
;;;             :   when saving a model.
;;; 2014.08.14 Dan
;;;             : * Printing module no longer needs the show-all-slots slot.
;;; 2014.09.26 Dan
;;;             : * Maintain a sorted list of module names so that things like
;;;             :   resetting can always be applied in the same order unlike
;;;             :   maphash which varies from Lisp to Lisp.
;;; 2014.11.04 Dan
;;;             : * Added a slot to indicate a request-param to the slot-spec
;;;             :   structure.
;;; 2015.03.19 Dan
;;;             : * Added the flags slot to the buffer struct to handle the
;;;             :   new failure option and provide a way for implementing other
;;;             :   such markers in the future.
;;; 2015.06.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added the one-time-tags slot to the printing module struct
;;;             :   to support the new one-time-model-warning command.
;;; 2015.07.29 Dan [2.1]
;;;             : * Changed the version number set in the meta-process to be
;;;             :   the concatenation of the two version strings.
;;;             : * Added a precondition slot to events which will be used to
;;;             :   allow ignoring "unneeded" events.
;;; 2015.08.03 Dan
;;;             : * Going back to *actr-version-string* being the whole thing
;;;             :   and changing that in the version-string file.
;;; 2015.08.25 Dan
;;;             : * Adding the real-time-scale slot to the meta-process to make
;;;             :   it easier to control the scaling in real-time mode.
;;; 2015.09.09 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Slot added to buffers to indicate whether its module will
;;;             :   report on completion of requests i.e. trackable.
;;;             : * Slot added to model struct for tracking requests.
;;; 2016.04.11 Dan
;;;             : * Converted the printing module to a class because then
;;;             :   supporting the :save-trace parameter and show-model-trace 
;;;             :   command can be done with a class allocated slot to hold
;;;             :   the event hook ids.  Keep the accessors for the slots the
;;;             :   same as they were for the struct to avoid having to change
;;;             :   lots of other code too.
;;; 2016.09.27 Dan [4.0]
;;;             : * Removed the meta-processes structure.
;;; 2016.09.28 Dan
;;;             : * The printing module's event-hook doesn't need to be a hash-table
;;;             :   since there's only one meta-process.
;;; 2017.02.27 Dan
;;;             : * Added class allocated slots to the printing-module to allow
;;;             :   warnings to be captured cleanly since *error-output* can't
;;;             :   just be monitored now.
;;; 2017.03.29 Dan
;;;             : * Added slots for lock tables in the meta-process and model
;;;             :   along with a lock in the buffer struct and a class lock in
;;;             :   the printing-module.
;;;             : * Removed the current-model and cannot-define-model slots.
;;; 2017.03.30 Dan
;;;             : * Moved the current-mp and current-mp-fct code here.
;;;             : * Also moved the model code from internal-macros here.
;;;             : * Added with-current-model which works like verify-current-model
;;;             :   except that it binds current-model to the current model struct
;;;             :   for use in the body.
;;;             : * Moved print-warning here too.
;;; 2017.04.27 Dan
;;;             : * Added a lock to the buffer structure to protect access.
;;; 2017.05.30 Dan
;;;             : * Adding a new piece to the internal organization -- a "component".
;;;             :   A component is installed at the meta-process level not the
;;;             :   model level.  It is not directly affected by resets, only 
;;;             :   clear-alls.  It has 5 interface functions:
;;;             :    - creation (called once at define-component time)
;;;             :    - destroy (called once at undefine-component time)
;;;             :    - clear-all (called at every clear-all)
;;;             :    - model-creation (called for every model that's defined)
;;;             :    - model-destruction (called for every model that's undefined)
;;;             :   Like a module its returned creation is the 'instance' and
;;;             :   there will be a get-component command, but since there is 
;;;             :   only 1 instance of a component it may not be necessary.
;;; 2017.06.02 Dan
;;;             : * Cleaned up some issues with the "current model" setting and
;;;             :   use.  Now nothing ever setfs *current-act-r-model* and 
;;;             :   current-model-struct is an or of that and the meta-p-default-
;;;             :   model.
;;; 2017.06.05 Dan
;;;             : * Adding slots for reset functions to components.
;;; 2017.06.15 Dan
;;;             : * Make the 'current model' macros thread safe by locking the
;;;             :   read of the meta-process default model slot.
;;;             : * Added a lock to the model struct to protect the modules table.
;;;             : * Added another lock to the printing module for checking/setting
;;;             :   parameters within a model (the other lock is class allocated).
;;;             : * Add the schedule-lock to the meta-process for locking all of
;;;             :   the time and event queue access.
;;;             : * Add a lock to the modules struct.
;;; 2017.06.16 Dan
;;;             : * Added another lock to printing module for the saved trace.
;;;             : * Make the printing module param lock recursive.
;;;             : * Added a component-lock to the meta-process.
;;; 2017.06.20 Dan
;;;             : * Added a lock to the act-r-chunk-type-info struct to protect
;;;             :   all access.  Since chunk-types are only modifided in the 
;;;             :   chunk-type functions the info lock is used to protect the 
;;;             :   underlying structs too.
;;; 2017.06.21 Dan
;;;             : * Added a lock for the chunk 'updating' slots to the model.
;;; 2017.06.23 Dan
;;;             : * Added names for all the locks.
;;; 2017.06.28 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the in-slack slot of the meta-process because it
;;;             :   isn't used anymore.
;;; 2017.06.29 Dan
;;;             : * Add a lock to the model struct for the buffers table.
;;; 2017.05.30 Dan
;;;             : * Add a lock for the meta-process event hook slots.
;;; 2017.07.14 Dan
;;;             : * Add a lock to the model for tracked-requests.
;;; 2017.09.19 Dan
;;;             : * Remove all the slots needed for the printing module to 
;;;             :   support the :save-trace parameter.
;;; 2017.12.07 Dan
;;;             : * Added an external slot to modules sturcture.
;;; 2018.02.05 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the evt- :conc-name from the event structure and
;;;             :   added a num slot for use as an id.
;;;             : * Added event-id slot to meta-process for creating them.
;;; 2018.02.07 Dan
;;;             : * Remove the unnecessary real-time params from the meta-process
;;;             :   and added the mode.
;;; 2018.04.13 Dan
;;;             : * The buffer-lock needs to be a recursive lock because buffer-
;;;             :   chunk locks it but get-m-buffer-chunks also does for a multi-
;;;             :   buffer.
;;; 2018.04.17 Dan
;;;             : * The modules lock also needs to be recursive.
;;; 2018.06.08 Dan
;;;             : * Add a tracked-requests id counter which is what the 'tracker'
;;;             :   uses to check things.
;;; 2019.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Updating the chunk-spec related structs to eliminate some 
;;;             :   unused slots and add some others to help with how they're used.
;;; 2019.02.05 Dan
;;;             : * Adjust meta-p-models to be an alist instead of hashtable.
;;; 2019.02.13 Dan
;;;             : * Add a slot to the model to hold a bitvector of buffers with
;;;             :   chunks in them and slots to the buffer to hold their index
;;;             :   and a mask.
;;; 2019.03.13 Dan
;;;             : * Change the chunk-type-info to get rid of slot->mask and to
;;;             :   specify tests for the hash tables.
;;; 2019.03.14 Dan
;;;             : * Can't use = as the test for a hash-table outside of ACL.
;;;             : * Just removing all the tests now.
;;; 2019.03.19 Dan
;;;             : * Added a slot to chunk-types for a possible-slots vector.
;;; 2019.04.03 Dan
;;;             : * Store a module instance in the buffer struct of a model
;;;             :   and a list of instances in the model.
;;; 2019.04.03 Dan
;;;             : * Added a slot to store the unique slot names in a chunk-spec
;;;             :   to avoid having to recompute them.
;;; 2019.04.09 Dan
;;;             : * Have the event priorities default to 0 and add slots for min
;;;             :   and max so priority values are always numbers.
;;; 2020.02.12 Dan
;;;             : * Added the merge-value slot to chunk parameters.
;;; 2020.05.29 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the name from the chunks' locks.
;;;             : * Added some slots to the model struct to store chunk-type
;;;             :   information after module creation to reapply at reset time
;;;             :   instead of repeatedly calling chunk-type i.e. if a module
;;;             :   calls it in the creation function it doesn't have to be done
;;;             :   in the reset function every time.
;;; 2020.06.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added some more slots to the model struct for caching the 
;;;             :   creation time chunks as well.
;;; 2020.07.23 Dan
;;;             : * Added slots to the act-r-output struct to indicate
;;;             :   whether the :v and :cmdt are using the same stream to fix
;;;             :   a problem when they're set to the same file.
