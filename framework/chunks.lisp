;;; ----- History -----
;;;
;;; 2004.09.02 Dan
;;;             : Creation
;;; 2005.01.16 Dan
;;;             : * Added chunk-copied-from.
;;;             : * Reduced most things to 80 columns (I don't want to split
;;;             :   the format string because I've had problems with the ~
;;;             :   new-line breaking with "non-native" line endings).
;;;             : * Added doc strings.
;;;             : * Modified pprint-a-chunk so it can print with or without
;;;             :   the parameters.
;;;             : * Removed the print-chunk-type function since I don't want to
;;;             :   hide the structure since users shouldn't see them anyway.
;;; 2005.01.17 Dan
;;;             : * Switched to using command-output for printing.
;;;             : * Renamed pprint-chunk pprint-chunkS and took away its
;;;             :   printing of chunk parameters and added pprint-chunks-plus 
;;;             :   to display chunks with chunk parameters. 
;;; 2005.01.21 Dan
;;;             : * Updated merge-chunks-fct to work more efficiently.
;;; 2005.01.24 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed some bugs I introduced with the changes to pprint-
;;;             :   chunks and pprint-chunks-plus - I changed their return 
;;;             :   value which broke other things...
;;; 2005.02.04 Dan
;;;             : * Added the fast-* chunk accessors to eliminate the 
;;;             :   excessive calling of valid-slot-name.
;;; 2005.02.09 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug that the fast-* stuff introduced with respect
;;;             :   to printing chunks.
;;; 2005.02.11 Dan
;;;             : * Some general clean up in define-chunks-fct.
;;; 2005.03.24 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the pprint-a-chunk function because it turns out
;;;             :   that some Lisps don't like using the pre-formatted format
;;;             :   string with the ~? directive.
;;; 2005.03.25 Dan
;;;             : * Changed pprint-a-chunk so that the slots print in the
;;;             :   same order as the chunk-type.
;;; 2005.04.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added true-chunk-name to help with an issue in merging
;;;             :   and may want to use it in printing and elsewhere...
;;; 2005.04.07 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a minor issue with define-chunks and how it creates
;;;             :   the name for a chunk without one specified.
;;; 2005.05.07 Dan
;;;             : * Changed copy-chunk-fct so that instead of naming the new
;;;             :   chunk based on the chunk-type it bases it on the actual
;;;             :   name of the chunk being copied.  I think this is easier
;;;             :   to follow in the traces, but maybe it's more confusing.
;;;             :   We'll find out from experience I guess and then determine
;;;             :   which is better...
;;; 2005.06.11 Dan
;;;             : * DOH!  I remember again why I used the chunktype for the
;;;             :   name of the copy - because vision for example uses things
;;;             :   like loc1 which now when copied ends up as loc10 which
;;;             :   of course looks like "loc"+"10" instead of "loc1"+"0".
;;;             :   So, I've changed it so that it adds a - between the
;;;             :   chunk's name and the number so that would be loc1-0.             
;;; 2005.08.10 Dan
;;;             : * Minor clean-up in define-chunks to remove unused variables
;;;             :   in the let.
;;;             : * Updated version to 1.0.
;;; 2005.09.14 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the output of a warning in define-chunks-fct
;;;             :   because invalid slot names weren't printed.
;;; 2005.11.17 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed some bugs in define-chunks-fct and pprint-a-chunk
;;;             :   related to default slot values in the chunk-type.
;;; 2006.01.03 Dan
;;;             : * Modified extend-chunks to remove the explicit compile call
;;;             :   (but still result in a compiled function at all times) to
;;;             :   hopefully get around the CMUCL issue.
;;; 2006.01.18 Dan
;;;             : * Modified the chunk printing function so that it can suppress
;;;             :   the "unfilled" extended slots of a chunk if desired.
;;; 2006.02.20 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in extend-chunks that causes problems with chunk 
;;;             :   parameters when merged when the ACT-R is both compiled and
;;;             :   loaded in the same session i.e. if one loads a previously
;;;             :   compiled version there's no problem so it shouldn't have
;;;             :   caused too many problems.
;;; 2006.07.06 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in define-chunks-fct.  When a chunk-type 
;;;             :   specified a default value for a slot which was a symbol (thus
;;;             :   interepreted as a chunk name) nothing ever created such a
;;;             :   chunk if it wasn't defined.  It doesn't make sense to do it
;;;             :   at the time of the chunk-type definition (because you may not
;;;             :   be able to create the chunk you want first) so it now happens
;;;             :   when such a slot value gets set (just like it does for any
;;;             :   non-chunk name symbols in the specified chunk slots).
;;; 2006.07.10 Dan
;;;             : * Added get-chunk-warn for use in several of the "user" functions
;;;             :   because they don't provide a warning if the chunk-name is
;;;             :   invalid, but since get-chunk is used for other purposes, 
;;;             :   I don't want to change it directly.
;;;             : * Added changed true-chunk-name to true-chunk-name-fct and
;;;             :   added a macro for true-chunk-name to make it user accessible.
;;; 2006.07.11 Dan
;;;             : * Made merge-chunks "safe" because previously it would merge
;;;             :   un-equal chunks as long as both items were really chunks.
;;;             :   Didn't cause problems since DM did the check first anyway,
;;;             :   but may be an issue if other modules were to use it.
;;; 2006.08.08 Dan
;;;             : * Put a test into define-chunks-fct so that it doesn't result
;;;             :   in errors for malformed add-dm/define-chunks calls, but just
;;;             :   prints a warning.
;;; 2006.10.10 Dan
;;;             : * Added the normalize-chunk-names command which goes through
;;;             :   all of the model's chunks and replaces any refrence to a
;;;             :   chunk name in a slot with the chunk's "true" name and then
;;;             :   optionally releases any non-true name i.e. the name that
;;;             :   was "merged away".  Generally, this probably won't see 
;;;             :   much use, but cleaning up the references may be useful at
;;;             :   times, and if a model creates so many names that the symbol
;;;             :   table becomes a memory limiter clearing those out maybe
;;;             :   necessary.
;;; 2006.10.17 Dan
;;;             : * Minor bug fix in normalize-chunk-names for the unintern 
;;;             :   clause.
;;; 2006.10.20 Dan
;;;             : * More clean-up added to normalize-chunk-names - should free
;;;             :   up more memory in the unintern case now.
;;; 2007.01.04 Dan
;;;             : * Minor tweak to chunk-copied-from-fct to make sure that the
;;;             :   "copied-from" chunk still exists - which may not be the case
;;;             :   for something like a goal or imaginal requests which delete 
;;;             :   the original.
;;; 2007.01.15 Dan
;;;             : * Bug from that last update fixed - use chunk-p-fct instead
;;;             :   of chunk-p...
;;; 2007.07.13 Dan
;;;             : * Performance enhancement for normalize-chunk-names - it
;;;             :   can skip checking the chunks for which the name change is
;;;             :   being done.  Duh!
;;; 2008.04.15 Dan
;;;             : * Performance improvement for delete-chunk-fct.  Assume that
;;;             :   the only way to get "eq" chunks in the table is through
;;;             :   merging so don't need to search the whole table to find
;;;             :   them for deletion - just use the merge-list from the chunk's
;;;             :   truename as the set of chunks to delete.
;;; 2008.04.16 Dan
;;;             : * Minor tweaks to normalize-chunk-names: if there aren't any
;;;             :   merged chunks it terminates early (unlikely situation) and
;;;             :   it now uses the fast- chunk component accessors.
;;; 2008.07.01 Dan
;;;             : * Added purge-chunk command to both delete and release the
;;;             :   name of the chunk.
;;; 2008.07.30 Dan
;;;             : * Changed an append to an nconc in merge-chunks-fct because
;;;             :   there's no need to copy the lists and performance wise it
;;;             :   makes a difference in the long run.
;;; 2008.07.31 Dan
;;;             : * Moved chunk-slot-equal from chunk-spec to here and removed
;;;             :   the equivalent equal-compare-slot-values function since
;;;             :   there don't need to be two such functions.  
;;;             : * Also improved chunk-slot-equal so that it doesn't need to
;;;             :   use eq-chunks-fct which may save 10% or more time wise for
;;;             :   models becuase it removes duplicate lookups.
;;;             : * Added the testing of val1 and val2 back into the chunk
;;;             :   case of chunk-slot-equal since a nil can short-circuit the
;;;             :   chunk lookup - slows down the chunk only cases but speeds
;;;             :   up the nil tests which is probably more common in the 
;;;             :   average model.
;;; 2008.10.08 Dan
;;;             : * Improvement to normalize-chunk-names so it doesn't have to
;;;             :   look up non-chunks.  
;;; 2008.10.20 Dan [1.1]
;;;             : * Made changes to add the option of having chunk merging 
;;;             :   work like the older ACT-R versions where it essentially 
;;;             :   normalizes as it goes. It can be enabled via the :dcnn 
;;;             :   parameter and is on by default.
;;; 2008.10.30 Dan
;;;             : * Tweaked chunk-slot-equal to make it a little more efficient.
;;; 2008.11.03 Dan [1.2]
;;;             : * Changed the internals of how chunk parameters get stored
;;;             :   from a hash-table to an array and added extra lists so that
;;;             :   copying and merging don't need to loop over all the parameters.
;;; 2008.11.04 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a minor bug with how the parameter copy list gets
;;;             :   created because compiling and loading the chunks file would
;;;             :   lead to calling the copy functions twice.
;;; 2008.11.11 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the chunk copy code.
;;; 2008.11.13 Dan
;;;             : * Modified chunk normalizing so that it calls the hook fn's
;;;             :   when it changes chunk slot values.
;;; 2008.12.10 Dan
;;;             : * Added the :copy-from-chunk-function keyword to extend
;;;             :   chunks because sometimes having access to the original 
;;;             :   chunk may be useful when copying a parameter.
;;; 2009.02.13 Dan
;;;             : * Modified chunk-copy-fct to better control for size since
;;;             :   the ANSI CL spec doesn't require this to be true:
;;;             :
;;;             :  (let* ((ht1 (make-hash-table))
;;;             :         (s1 (hash-table-size ht1))
;;;             :         (ht2 (make-hash-table :size s1))
;;;             :         (s2 (hash-table-size ht2)))
;;;             :    (= s1 s2))
;;;             :
;;;             :   which can result in runaway memory usage if a chunk gets
;;;             :   copied, then the copy gets copied, and so on, in a Lisp which 
;;;             :   "rounds up" the size (ACL and possibly others).
;;; 2009.02.13 Dan
;;;             : * Modified chunk-copy-fct to use the new option of "short
;;;             :   chunk copy names".  So, instead of A-0-0-0-0 one would have
;;;             :   A-3 instead.
;;; 2009.04.23 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug introduced in chunk-slot-equal the last time it 
;;;             :   was updated which caused t to match any non-chunk value if
;;;             :   t was also not explicitly defined as a chunk.
;;; 2010.04.30 Dan
;;;             : * Updated delete-chunk-fct so that it doesn't print a double
;;;             :   warning for deleting a chunk which is still used and also
;;;             :   fixed an unnecessary ' in the warning.
;;; 2010.08.16 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in delete-chunk-fct that would throw an error
;;;             :   if a non-chunk were passed in.
;;; 2010.08.17 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the extend-chunk macro so that the accessor and setf
;;;             :   funtions for a parameter include the parameter in the warning
;;;             :   when there's a bad chunk name provided.
;;; 2011.04.27 Dan
;;;             : * Added some declaims to avoid compiler warnings about 
;;;             :   undefined functions.
;;; 2011.04.28 Dan
;;;             : * Added a mechanism for suppressing the warnings that get
;;;             :   printed when chunks are extended during compile and load.
;;; 2011.05.19 Dan
;;;             : * Added the create-chunk-alias command that allows one to
;;;             :   add new chunk names that refer to existing chunks.
;;; 2012.05.30 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in the create-chunk-alias macro.
;;; 2012.10.15 Dan
;;;             : * Changed chunk-back-links to use a hash-table instead of a
;;;             :   list of lists to improve performance.  Significant reduction
;;;             :   in time and memory usage when :ncnar is t found in test 
;;;             :   cases.
;;; 2013.03.13 Dan [1.3]
;;;             : * Changed chunk creation so that all slots which exist for
;;;             :   the chunk get set in the table, even if they are empty, 
;;;             :   because that's important for matching chunk-specs now since
;;;             :   a non-existent slot needs to be diferentiated from an empty
;;;             :   slot.
;;; 2013.04.05 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with creating chunks that have default values in
;;;             :   slots which are themselves chunks.
;;;             : * Re-fixed because I undid the previous change which is still
;;;             :   important.
;;; 2013.05.20 Dan 
;;;             : * Added the resolve-a-static-chunks-type function to handle
;;;             :   converting a chunk to the minimal type needed for holding
;;;             :   its contents.
;;; 2013.05.21 Dan
;;;             : * Fast-mod-chunk and define-chunk now resolves static chunks so
;;;             :   that they are always of the most appropriate type.
;;; 2013.05.22 Dan
;;;             : * Changed pprint-a-chunk so that static chunks show the root
;;;             :   type or current type based on the setting of the :show-static-
;;;             :   subtype-names parameter.
;;; 2013.05.23 Dan
;;;             : * Changed define-chunks to now allow one to specify any possible
;;;             :   slots when creating static chunks even if only the parent type
;;;             :   is provided, but won't allow creating as yet undefined type
;;;             :   combinations e.g. if the root type is x and you've extended
;;;             :   x with a slot1 and extended x with a slot2 but haven't extended
;;;             :   either of those (x+slot1 or x+slot2) with the other to create
;;;             :   x+slot1&slot2 a definition for a chunk like this:
;;;             :   (isa x slot1 "a" slot2 "b") will fail, but either of these: 
;;;             :   (isa x slot1 "a") (isa x slot2 "b") would be fine.
;;;             : * Fixed resolve-chunks-type so that it doesn't remove the
;;;             :   static slots of the root type from the chunks i.e. those are
;;;             :   allowed to have a value of nil and still exist.
;;; 2014.02.12 Dan
;;;             : * Changed pprint-a-chunk to use canonical-chunk-type-name 
;;;             :   instead of directly testing the type and static printing
;;;             :   state.
;;; 2014.02.17 Dan
;;;             : * Changed set-chk-slot-value so that it resolves a static
;;;             :   chunk's type after the change.
;;;             : * Set the creation-type slot when creating a chunk and check
;;;             :   that when resolving a chunk's type.  If it moves up the
;;;             :   hierarchy allow the slots of the creation type to still be
;;;             :   used in set and mod operations for verification of valid 
;;;             :   slots until it either has the same type as its creation
;;;             :   type or becomes a type which isn't a supertype of the 
;;;             :   creation type.  What this allows is the following sequence
;;;             :   of operations which are used by some of the device code to
;;;             :   create visual features 'incrementally':
;;;             :   (chunk-type foo)
;;;             :   (chunk-type (bar (:include foo)) slot)
;;;             :   (define-chunk (a isa bar)) ;; falls back to foo at this point
;;;             :   (set-chunk-slot-value a slot t) ;; want to set that slot later
;;; 2014.02.24 Dan [2.0]
;;;             : * Move to chunks not maintaining type information at runtime.
;;;             : * Instead it just keeps a bitvector of slots which have values
;;;             :   in them based on a global slot mapping.
;;;             : * Setting and modifying slot values will automatically extend
;;;             :   the chunk.  Automatic extension however will print a model
;;;             :   warning.
;;;             : * Chunks can be marked as immutable now and trying to change
;;;             :   such a chunk doesn't work and prints a warning.
;;;             : * Don't print an ISA when printing a chunk.
;;; 2014.02.25 Dan 
;;;             : * Switch slot-value-lists back to a list of cons from a hashtable.
;;;             : * Chunk-slot-value doesn't warn for missing slots, just returns nil.
;;; 2014.03.05 Dan
;;;             : * Go all out and make the isa optional in chunk definition. 
;;;             :   Print warnings for any slots that aren't already defined and
;;;             :   then extend things to compensate (basically the same as with
;;;             :   undefined chunks).
;;; 2014.03.13 Dan
;;;             : * Require chunk names to start with an alphanumeric.  That 
;;;             :   prevents a lot of potential weirdness in production compilation
;;;             :   because imagine what happens if a chunk named =goal or worse
;;;             :   =goal> were instantiated into a compiled production not to
;;;             :   mention things like just =val, +retrieval>, or ==>.
;;; 2014.03.18 Dan
;;;             : * Added the mod-chunk-with-spec-fct function.
;;; 2014.03.26 Dan
;;;             : * Added chunk-filled-slots-vector for accessing the info from
;;;             :   a chunk-name.
;;; 2014.03.27 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the warning for create-undefined-chunk to say no
;;;             :   slots instead of default type chunk.
;;; 2014.04.01 Dan
;;;             : * Already had chunk-slots-vector so no need for chunk-filled-slots-
;;;             :   vector...
;;; 2014.05.21 Dan
;;;             : * Allow the :merge-function for extend-chunks to take the value
;;;             :   :second instead of a function to just set the value based on
;;;             :   that of the second chunk instead of having to write a function
;;;             :   to do so for each parameter.
;;; 2014.06.17 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed define-chunks-fct to disambiguate what a definition 
;;;             :   like this means: (name "doc") since that could be a chunk 
;;;             :   name and documentation string or it could be an unnamed 
;;;             :   chunk with a slot named name with a value of "doc".  The
;;;             :   second interpretation is how it works now and the only way
;;;             :   to specify a doc string is to also name the chunk and specify
;;;             :   an isa.
;;;             :   Here are the valid options:
;;;             :     {slot value}+
;;;             :     <name> {slot value}+
;;;             :     isa <type> {slot value}+
;;;             :     <name> isa <type> {slot value}+
;;;             :     <name> <"doc"> isa <type> {slot value}+
;;; 2014.06.19 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug that allowed a chunk to have more than one 
;;;             :   instance of a slot.
;;; 2014.06.20 Dan
;;;             : * Only create undefined chunks if the name is valid for a 
;;;             :   chunk i.e. starts with an alphanumeric.
;;;             : * Also test that when extending slots.
;;; 2014.06.24 Dan
;;;             : * Allow all chunk definitions to extend the slots, even if it's
;;;             :   got a type specified, but do a hard warning when there's a
;;;             :   type specified.
;;; 2014.10.15 Dan
;;;             : * When merging chunks need to make sure that if either is 
;;;             :   immutable then the resulting chunk is also.
;;; 2014.10.17 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug with recording the documentation string for a
;;;             :   chunk that didn't have a name -- this makes it possible
;;;             :   to also specify things as: 
;;;             :     <"doc"> isa <type> {slot value}*
;;;             :   Note that for all those listed above the + should be a * as
;;;             :   well since not slot vlaue pairs are required.
;;; 2014.10.20 Dan
;;;             : * Modify mod-chunk-fct so that it returns nil for all of the
;;;             :   "bad" situations instead of letting set-chk-slot-value fail
;;;             :   and then returning the chunk-name.
;;; 2014.11.10 Dan
;;;             : * Tweak pprint-a-chunk to avoid the issue with ~ and the output
;;;             :   macros.
;;; 2014.11.11 Dan
;;;             : * Add a check to extend-chunks to make sure the parameter
;;;             :   name is a symbol and not a keyword.
;;;             : * Add tests to make sure the functions provided are actually
;;;             :   functions.
;;; 2014.11.13 Dan
;;;             : * Remove the checking of the extend-chunks functions because
;;;             :   of potential issues with compile time vs load time checking.
;;; 2014.12.17 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the declaim for some functions because they didn't
;;;             :   indicate multiple return values and some Lisps care
;;;             :   about that.
;;; 2015.03.13 Dan
;;;             : * Don't try to create a chunk for a keyword used in a slot
;;;             :   value.  Treat it like a number or string and leave it alone.
;;; 2015.04.22 Dan
;;;             : * Chunk-copied-from now has a second return value when the
;;;             :   parameter is a valid chunk name.  The second return value
;;;             :   is the act-r-chunk-copied-from value for the chunk which
;;;             :   could be the name of a chunk which is no longer equal to the
;;;             :   copy because it had been changed, a symbol which doesn't
;;;             :   name a chunk anymore because it has been deleted, or nil if
;;;             :   the chunk itself has been modified or wasn't a copy to begin
;;;             :   with.  If the second value is non-nil then that means that
;;;             :   the chunk was created as a copy and hasn't been itself
;;;             :   modified since then.
;;; 2016.06.27 Dan
;;;             : * Removed some duplicate testing when using mod-chunk or mod-
;;;             :   chunk-with-spec since set-chk-slot-value retested the 
;;;             :   immutability of the chunk and the validity of the slot name.
;;;             :   Now there's a set-slot-value below set-chk-slot-value which
;;;             :   can be used if the chunk is immutable and the slot name is
;;;             :   valid -- calling that otherwise will lead to problems and
;;;             :   it's not intended for user code.
;;;             : * Reverse the order of the initial tests in convert-slot-value-
;;;             :   to-true since get-chunk is costly and unnecessary if the
;;;             :   renaming is off anyway.
;;; 2016.06.28 Dan
;;;             : * Changed set-slot-value to set-c-slot-value.
;;;             : * Compressed create-slot-value-chunk-if-needed and convert-slot-
;;;             :   value-to-true into get-true-slot-value-name to save some
;;;             :   overhead.
;;; 2016.12.19 Dan [3.0]
;;;             : * Added define-chunks as a command through the dispatcher and
;;;             :   define-chunks-fct now uses that.
;;; 2017.01.04 Dan
;;;             : * Because define-chunks can recursively call itself through
;;;             :   create-undefined-chunk I've hacked that for now so that it
;;;             :   directly calls the internal function instead of going out
;;;             :   through the dispatcher again since that would deadlock 
;;;             :   because define-chunks is set to be single instance -- which
;;;             :   it must be!  That means monitoring define-chunks will not be
;;;             :   sufficient to track all of the model's chunks, but since this
;;;             :   situation generates a warning it is an "unusual" circumstance
;;;             :   and for now I'm considering that reasonable behavior.
;;; 2017.01.18 Dan
;;;             : * Removed the echo-act-r-output from define-chunks.  The assumption
;;;             :   now is that echoing is handled by the user.
;;;             : * Use handle-evaluate-results.
;;; 2017.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Add-act-r-command call parameters reordered.
;;; 2017.02.08 Dan
;;;             : * Define-chunks now handles string based (remote) calls.
;;;             : * Added external pprint-chunks, chunk-slot-value, mod-chunk,
;;;             :   set-chunk-slot-value commands.
;;; 2017.02.15 Dan
;;;             : * Chunk-p-fct now accepts strings as names.
;;;             : * If chunk-slot-value-fct gets a string for the chunk name
;;;             :   and the slot value is a string then it encodes that result
;;;             :   into the special quoted string for returning.
;;;             : * Don't allow chunk-p-fct to take a string for a name!  Instead,
;;;             :   have remote calls routed to a special chunk-p-fct which does
;;;             :   the string to name decoding.
;;;             : * Added the remote chunk-p function.
;;; 2017.02.27 Dan
;;;             : * Changed the test in define-chunks-internal for decoding the
;;;             :   chunk-def list to include null items.
;;; 2017.03.13 Dan
;;;             : * Added a remote copy-chunk and have that one convert
;;;             :   the name if it's a string but don't change the internal
;;;             :   for the same efficiency reasons that chunk-p doesn't.
;;; 2017.06.20 Dan
;;;             : * Protecting access to the model chunk table and ref-table with
;;;             :   the model's lock.
;;;             : * Added a lock to protect the parameter table.
;;; 2017.06.21 Dan
;;;             : * Adding the individual chunk locking to everything.
;;; 2017.06.22 Dan
;;;             : * Define-chunks and copy-chunk don't need to be single instance.
;;; 2017.06.23 Dan
;;;             : * Added a name to the lock.
;;; 2017.08.09 Dan
;;;             : * Added printed-chunk to use as a replacement for capture-output
;;;             :   on pprint-chunks.
;;; 2017.12.06 Dan
;;;             : * Added remote versions of delete and purge chunk.
;;; 2017.12.08 Dan
;;;             : * Added a remote chunk-copied-from.
;;; 2018.01.09 Dan
;;;             : * Allow define-chunks to get just symbols/strings for the
;;;             :   items and create those as chunks with no slots or values.
;;;             :   For safety reasons at this point only do that if all the items
;;;             :   are atoms instead of allowing a mixture, but may want to 
;;;             :   relax that in the future.
;;; 2018.02.27 Dan
;;;             : * The notify-on-the-fly hooks might be dispatch commands so
;;;             :   need to use dispatch-apply instead of funcall.
;;; 2018.04.13 Dan
;;;             : * Fixed a bug in a warning from internal-define-chunks.
;;; 2018.06.12 Dan
;;;             : * Starting to have only remote commands allow strings for names
;;;             :   (not true for define-chunks yet because having it go through
;;;             :   the dispatcher for protection needs to change).
;;; 2018.06.13 Dan
;;;             : * Don't require define-chunks-fct to go through the dispatcher.
;;;             :   I think I did that so it could be monitored for any chunk
;;;             :   creation, but I don't see that being useful and since it's
;;;             :   not single instance it doesn't provide any extra protection.
;;;             : * Finish the transition to only remote commands using the 
;;;             :   string names and extra quoting for stings as slot values.
;;; 2018.06.14 Dan
;;;             : * Adding an additional option for the merge function in a new
;;;             :   chunk parameter :second-if which sets it to the value of the
;;;             :   second chunk only if that value is non-nil otherwise it stays
;;;             :   as the c1 value.
;;; 2018.07.27 Dan [4.0]
;;;             : * Make extend-chunks available remotely as well as create the
;;;             :   external commands to use it - the accessor is the same as
;;;             :   the Lisp accessor and the setter is called set-<accessor>.
;;;             :   Also allow the functions to be remote commands.  Note, the
;;;             :   external version uses the string double-quoting mechanism
;;;             :   for all the keyword parameters so that one can specify a 
;;;             :   Lisp function or value instead of a remote command as the 
;;;             :   value (in particular setting identity for the copy function 
;;;             :   or one of the keyword options for merging).
;;; 2018.08.23 Dan
;;;             : * Added remote chunk-filled-slots-list and chunks.
;;; 2019.01.30 Dan
;;;             : * Don't need to repeatedly grab the lock for param size.
;;; 2019.03.06 Dan
;;;             : * Tried storing the slot struct in the chunks, but not a 
;;;             :   noticeable difference in performance.
;;;             : * Now trying the index instead.
;;; 2019.03.14 Dan
;;;             : * Undoing the change to indexes, since it actually hurt the
;;;             :   overall performance on the zbrodoff test model, but keeping
;;;             :   some of the minor cleanups that went along with it.
;;; 2019.04.04 Dan
;;;             : * valid-ct-slot now returns the slot-struct so save a test
;;;             :   by using that.
;;; 2019.06.06 Dan
;;;             : * Add an external printed-chunk command.
;;; 2020.02.05 Dan [4.1]
;;;             : * Adding remote versions for most of the commands.
;;; 2020.02.11 Dan
;;;             : * Added a remote make-chunk-immutable.
;;; 2020.02.12 Dan [5.0]
;;;             : * Fixed an issue with external extend-chunks because it needs
;;;             :   to do the string decoding on all the functions so that they
;;;             :   can be set to external commands.
;;;             : * Because merging holds the locks on the chunks you can't
;;;             :   access a parameter's value in an external command for 
;;;             :   merging or copying thus need to add a merge-values-fn
;;;             :   hook that passes the values as a work around (basically 
;;;             :   parallel the copy and copy-from-chunk functions).
;;; 2020.08.24 Dan
;;;             : * Replaced constants that had *...* with +...+ to avoid the
;;;             :   warnings in SBCL.
;;; 2020.08.25 Dan
;;;             : * Switch from defconstant to the define-constant macro to 
;;;             :   avoid issues with SBCL (instead of redefining defconstant
;;;             :   for SBCL as was done previously).
;;; 2020.09.09 Dan
;;;             : * If either parameter hasn't had a value set for a parameter,
;;;             :   then the merge-value-function needs to get the default value
;;;             :   instead of the undefined value. (Can happen if there isn't
;;;             :   a copy function because it only sets the default when needed
;;;             :   if there isn't one.)
